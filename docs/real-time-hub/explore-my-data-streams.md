# Explore My data streams in Fabric Real-Time hub

When you navigate to Real-Time hub in Fabric, you can view data streams in different ways. For more information, see [Explore streams in Fabric Real-Time hub](explore-data-streams.md). This article covers the **My data streams** page, which allows you to view only the data streams that you brought into Fabric.
