# Copilot tenant settings
Fabric Copilot settings are controlled by the **Copilot and Azure OpenAI Service** tenant settings group.â€‹ There are multiple settings governing user access and data processing policies, and some of them are enabled by default whereas others require the Fabric administrator to enable them.

## Enabled by default

### Users can use Copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI

When this setting is enabled, users can access the features powered by Azure OpenAI, including Copilot. This setting can be managed at both the tenant and the capacity levels. For more information, see [Overview of Copilot in Fabric](../fundamentals/copilot-fabric-overview.md).

### Data sent to Azure OpenAI can be processed outside your capacity's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance

This setting is only applicable for customers who want to use Copilot and AI features in Fabric powered by Azure OpenAI, and whose capacity's geographic region is outside of the EU data boundary and the US. For more information, see [Available regions](../fundamentals/copilot-fabric-overview.md#available-regions).
## Not enabled by default

### Capacities can be designated as Fabric Copilot capacities.  

Copilot capacities enable users' usage and billing to be consolidated under a single capacity. Fabric administrators can assign specific groups or the entire organization to manage capacities as Fabric Copilot capacities. Capacity administrators must designate user access to each Copilot capacity and can view item names linked to users' Copilot activity in the Fabric capacity metrics app.
