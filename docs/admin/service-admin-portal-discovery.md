# Discovery tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings).

[Discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) is a feature that dataset owners can use to make their endorsed content discoverable by users who don't yet have access to it.

## Make promoted content discoverable

Allow users in this organization who can [promote content](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-endorse-content#promote-content) to make content they promote discoverable by users who don't have access to it. You can also specify users and/or groups to exclude from the permitted groups. 

To learn more, see [Dataset discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery).

## Make certified content discoverable

Allow users in the organization who can [certify content](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-endorse-content#certify-content) to make content they certify discoverable by users who don't have access to it.

## Discover content

Allow users to find and request access to content they don't have access to if it was made discoverable by its owners.
