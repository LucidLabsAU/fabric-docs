# Use the Invoke pipeline activity to run another pipeline

The Fabric Invoke pipeline activity can execute another [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] pipeline. You can use it to orchestrate the execution of one or multiple pipelines from within a single pipeline.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add an Invoke pipeline activity to a pipeline with UI

To use an Invoke pipeline activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for **Invoke pipeline** in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Information the user should notice even if skimmingIf your window size is not wide enough, the icon may appear without the text **Invoke pipeline** on the toolbar, although hovering over it will display its name.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Invoke pipeline settings

Select the **Settings** tab, and choose an existing pipeline from the **Invoked pipeline** dropdown, or use the **+ New** button to create a new pipeline directly. You can choose to wait on completion, or continue directly, in which case the invoked pipeline executes in parallel with activities following it within the parent pipeline's execution flow.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

Switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline.  Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it.  You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
