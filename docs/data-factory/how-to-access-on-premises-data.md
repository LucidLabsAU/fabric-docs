# How to access on-premises data sources in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric is a powerful cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and manage workflows for various data sources. In scenarios where your data sources are located on-premises, Microsoft provides the On-Premises Data Gateway to securely bridge the gap between your on-premises environment and the cloud. This document will guide you through the process of accessing on-premises data sources within Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric using the On-Premises Data Gateway.

## Create an on-premises data gateway

1. An on-premises data gateway is a software application designed to be installed within a local network environment. It provides a means to directly install the gateway onto your local machine. For detailed instructions on how to download and install the on-premises data gateway, please refer to [Install an on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install).

1. Log in using your user account to access the on-premises data gateway, after which it will be prepared for utilization.

## Create a connection for your on-premises data source

1. Navigate to the [admin portal](https://app.powerbi.com) and select the settings button (an icon that looks like a gear) at the top right of the page. Then choose Manage connections and gateways from the dropdown menu that appears.

1. On the **New connection** dialog that appears, select **On-premises** and then provide your gateway cluster, along with the associated resource type and relevant information.

## Connect your on-premises data source to a Dataflow Gen2 in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric

1. Go to your workspace and create a Dataflow Gen2.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Please be aware that the Fabric pipeline currently does not offer support for on-premises data sources. However, you can implement a workaround by initially transferring the data to a cloud storage using a Dataflow Gen2.

1. Add a new source to the dataflow and select the connection established in the previous step.

1. You can use the Dataflow Gen2 to perform any necessary data transformations based on your requirements.

1. Use the **Add data destination** button on the **Home** tab of the Power Query editor to add a destination for your data from the on-premises source.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/add-destination.png" lightbox="media/how-to-access-on-premises-data/add-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Power Query editor with the Add data destination button selected, showing the available destination types.":::

1. Publish the Dataflow Gen2.

You have now created a Dataflow Gen2 to load data from an on-premises data source into a cloud destination.

## Using on-premises data in a pipeline

Fabric pipelines can leverage on-premises data gateway for on-premises data access and data movement. Although Fabric pipeline currently does not offer support for on-premises data sources directly, you can implement a workaround by initially transferring the data to cloud storage using a Dataflow Gen2 as described in this article, and then accessing the cloud storage from the pipeline to work with the data.
