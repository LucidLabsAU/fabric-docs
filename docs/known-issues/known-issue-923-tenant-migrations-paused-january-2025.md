# Known issue - Tenant migration requests stopped

At Microsoft Fabric, we're committed to ensuring our platform meets the highest standards of consistency and security. We conducted a thorough review of the tenant migration processes to understand whether it aligns with our standards. Due to this review and the technical challenges associated with cross-region tenant migrations, we decided to no longer offer the tenant migration service.

**Status:** Closed: April 15, 2025

**Product Experience:** Power BI

## Symptoms

We no longer offer the cross-region tenant migration service.

## Solutions and workarounds

You can use alternate methods for moving a tenant to another region, such as [multi-geo capacities or tenant remap](/power-bi/support/service-admin-region-move).
