# Data Activator limitations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Fabric and Data Activator are in preview.

Data Activator is subject to the following limitations and considerations.

## Supported Power BI visuals

Data activator only supports the following Power BI visual types:

* Stacked column
* Clustered column
* Stacked bar
* 100% stacked column
* 100% stacked bar
* Clustered bar
* Ribbon chart
* Line
* Area
* Stacked area
* Line and stacked column
* Line and clustered column
* Pie
* Donut
* Gauge
* Card
* KPIs

Data activator also supports the following map visuals. Data activator only supports map visuals that use the *Location* field to specify the location of objects on the map. Data Activator does not support visuals that use *Latitude* and *Longitude* fields.

* Bing Map
* Filled Map
* Azure Map
* Arc GIS map


## Allowed recipients of email alerts

Each recipient of email alerts must be an internal email address, which means the recipient must belong to the organization that owns the Fabric tenant. Data Activator does not allow email alerts to be sent to either external email addresses nor guest email addresses.

## Maximum data throughput for Eventstreams data

For Eventstreams data sources, Data Activator supports throughput up to two events per second. If you send Eventstreams data to Data Activator at a more frequent rate, Data Activator may throttle the input, which means that Data Activator would not process all events in the stream.

## Maximum number of trigger actions

Data Activator imposes the following limits on the number of trigger actions that may occur in a given time period. If a trigger action occurs that exceeds the limit, Data Activator may throttle the action, which means that Data Activator would not execute the specified action.


|Trigger action  |Scope  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Email     |Messages/reflex item/hour         |500        |
|Email     |Messages/trigger/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/reflex item/hour         |500        |
|Teams     |Messages/trigger/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/recipient/hour           |100        |
|Teams     |Messages/Teams tenant/second      |50         |
|PA        |Flow executions/trigger/hour      |10000      |
