# Get data for Data Activator from Eventstreams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Fabric and Data Activator are in preview.

You can get data for use in Data Activator from many sources. This article describes how to get data from Eventstreams.

## Get data from Eventstreams 

If you have real-time streaming data in Fabric Eventstreams, you can connect it to Data Activator. This section explains how.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need an Eventstream item in Fabric with an existing connection to a Source. Each event in the source must consist of a JSON dictionary, and one of the dictionary keys must represent a unique object ID. Here's an example of an event that meets these criteria:

```
{
"PackageID": "PKG123",
"Temperature": 25
}
```

In this example, *PackageID* is the unique ID key.

### Connect your Eventstream item to Data Activator

To connect your Eventstream item to data activator:

1. Open your Eventstream item
2. Add a destination to your Eventstream item, of type *Reflex*

3. In the side panel, select an existing reflex item, or make a new one, as appropriate, then select *Add.*
4. Open your reflex item. You see the data flowing from your Eventstream item in the data pane.

### Next steps

Once you have connected your Eventstream item to data activator, the next step is to assign your data to some objects. To do this, follow the steps described in the [Assign data to objects in Data Activator](data-activator-assign-data-objects.md) article.
