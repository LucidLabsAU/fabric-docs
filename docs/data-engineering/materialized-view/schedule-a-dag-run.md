# Schedule a DAG run

Scheduling the DAG runs is an option provided to the users to decide how frequently the MVâ€™s need to be refreshed as per business requirements when and how the DAG should be executed to refresh the materialized view.

## Determining the Schedule

The schedule for running the DAG depends on various factors, such as:
* Data update frequency: How often does the source data change?
* Query performance requirements: How fresh does the data in the materialized view need to be?
*	System load: What is the optimal time to run the DAG without overloading the system?

## Implementing the Schedule

Click on the Schedule button on the Lakehouse in the DAG view

The schedule UI opens and is visible to the user.

:::image type="content" source="./media/schedule-a-dag-run/schedule-inputs.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the schedule UI where user sends their inputs for scheduling." border="true" lightbox="./media/schedule-a-dag-run/schedule-inputs.png":::


Click on the Schedule Refresh **On** button.
Select the following from the schedule UI:

*	Repeat (By the minute/Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
*	Every(Frequency/Date/Time/Month)
*	Start Date
*	End Date and Time
*	Time Zone

**Click on Apply**
The schedule is set for the particular DAG.

> [!Note]
> The scheduler will reflect the users local time.
