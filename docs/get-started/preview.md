# Microsoft Fabric preview information

Microsoft Fabric is a prerelease online service that is currently in public preview and may be substantially modified before it's released. Preview online service products and features aren't complete but are made available on a preview basis so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

This article describes the Microsoft Fabric preview state, and provides disclaimers related to preview.
