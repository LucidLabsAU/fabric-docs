# Known issue - New throttling logic delayed for Power BI and eventstream

On October 1, Fabric launched a new capacity throttling logic to reduce throttling for intermittent usage spikes and prevent overloading capacity. All experiences use the new throttling logic except for Power BI and eventstream.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Administration & Management

## Symptoms

Power BI and eventstream users don't currently see the benefits of the new throttling logic.

## Solutions and workarounds

No workarounds at this time. Power BI and eventstream will move to the new throttling logic on October 13.
