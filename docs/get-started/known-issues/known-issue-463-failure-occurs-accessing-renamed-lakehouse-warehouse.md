# Known issue - Failure occurs when accessing a renamed Lakehouse or Warehouse

After renaming your Lakehouse or Warehouse items in Microsoft Fabric, you may experience a failure when trying to access the SQL endpoint or Warehouse item using client tools or the Web user experience. The failure happens when the underlying SQL file system isn't properly updated after the rename operation resulting in different names in the portal and SQL file system.

**Status:** Open

**Product Experience:** Data Warehouse

## Symptoms

You'll see an HTTP status code 500 failure after renaming your Lakehouse or Warehouse when trying to access the renamed items.
