# Variable library CI/CD (preview)

Variable libraries make it easy to manage configurations across different stages of the release pipeline and to save values in Git. This article explains how to use Variable libraries in the context of lifecycle management and CI/CD.

## Variable libraries and deployment pipelines

Variable libraries and their values can be deployed in deployment pipelines to manage variable values across different stages. Each stage has its own active value set which can be changed at any time.

* Permissions for Item reference are checked during deployment.
* If you update the Variable library or any of its variables, the item will appear as different in a granular compare.

## Variable libraries and Git integration

Variable library items are stored as folders that can be maintained and synced between Fabric and your Git provider.

The Variable library item schema is a JSON object that contains three parts:

* Variable library name

  * [Value sets](#value-set): Contains a JSON file for each value set.
  * platform.json: [Automatically generated](../git-integration/source-code-format.md#platform-file) file.
  * [variables.json](#variables): Contains the variables and their default values.


## Variable library schema

The Variable library item schema is a JSON object that contains three parts:

* [Variables](#variables) – The variables contained in the item, and their properties.
  * name
  * type
  * defaultValue
  * note (if any)
* [Value-sets](#value-set): A set of values for the variables. A value set consists of:
  * name
  * value
* [platform.json](../git-integration/source-code-format.md#platform-file): Automatically generated file.

### Variables

The variables.json file contains the variables and their default values. For example:

```json
{
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "WaitTime",
      "type": "integer",
      "defaultValue": 1,
      "note": "Wait time in minutes"
    },
    {
      "name": "var2",
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "value2"
    }
  ],
}
```

### Value set

The variable library folder contains a subfolder called ValueSets. This subfolder contains a JSON file for each value set. The JSON file contains only the variable values for non default values in that value set. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "TestVL",
  "variableOverrides": [
    {
      "name": "WaitTime",
      "value": "3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Item permissions are checked during Git Update and commit.

## Considerations and limitations

* There can be *up to 1,000 variables* and *up to 1,000 value-sets*, as long as the total number of cells in the alternative value-sets is under 10,000 cells, and the item’s size not bigger than 3 MB. This is validated when the user saves changes.
* The note field can have up to 2,048 characters.
* The value-set description field can have up to 2,048 characters.
