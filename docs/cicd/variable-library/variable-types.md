# Variable names and types (preview)

A Variable library item in Microsoft Fabric contains a list of variables and their default values. It can also contain other value sets holding alternative values.

Each variable in the Variable library has the following properties:

- Name
- Note (optional)
- Type
- Default value set
- Alternative value sets value â€“ A pointer to the default value, unless it was changed to be a static/fixed value.

## Naming conventions

### Variable library name

The name of Variable library item itself must follow these conventions:

- Isn't empty.
- Doesn't have leading or trailing spaces.
- Starts with a letter.
- Can include letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
- Doesn't exceed 256 characters in length.

The Variable library name is *not* case sensitive.
