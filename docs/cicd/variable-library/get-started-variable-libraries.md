# How to use Variable libraries (preview)

The Microsoft Fabric Variable library is a tool that allows you to customize and share item configurations in a workspace. This article explains how to create a Variable library item and add variables to it.

## Prerequisites

To create Variable library items in Fabric, you need:

* A Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
* A [workspace](../../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* The following [tenant switches](../../admin/about-tenant-settings.md) must be enabled from the Admin portal:
  * [Users can create Fabric items](../../admin/fabric-switch.md)

  These switches can be enabled by the tenant admin, capacity admin, or workspace admin, depending on your [organization's settings](../../admin/delegate-settings.md).

## Create a Variable library item

You can create a Variable library item from the Fabric home page or from inside your workspace.

### [From home page](#tab/home-page)

1. From the side navigation bar, select **Create** (If itâ€™s not there, select the three dots -> create)
1. In the **Data Factory** section, select **Variable library**

1. Name the new Variable library and select **Create**. Make sure the name conforms to the required [naming conventions](./variable-types.md#variable-library-name).

### [From workspace](#tab/workspace)

1. Select **+ New item**
1. Scroll down to the **Develop data** section, and select **Variable library**

1. Name the new Variable library and select **Create**. Make sure the name conforms to the required [naming conventions](./variable-types.md#variable-library-name).

An empty Variable library appears. You can now add variables to it.

## Add a variable

To add a variable to the library:

1. Select **+ New variable**
1. Enter a name (make sure it follows the [naming conventions](./variable-types.md#name-of-a-variable-in-the-variable-library))
1. Select a type from the drop-down list
1. Enter default value set of the defined type
1. Add one or more alternative value sets (optional)
1. Add a note explaining what the variable is for or how to use it (optional)

## Edit a variable

The following operations can be performed from the top menu bar:

* To delete a variable, select one or more variables and select **Delete variable**.
* To edit the name, type, or value set of a variable, change the value and select **Save**.
* To add another alternative value set, select **Add value set**.

Selecting **Save** after editing any variable in the Variable library triggers an error validation check to make sure all the variable names and values are valid. Any errors must be fixed before the changes are saved.

## Edit a value set

To edit a value set, select the three dots next to the name of the value set.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-with-variable-libraries/edit-value-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit value set options. There are three options, set as active, Rename, and Delete.":::

You have the following options:

* Set as active value set
* Rename the value set
* Delete the value set

Select **Save**.
