## Prerequisites

To create variable library items in Fabric, you need:

* A Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
* A [workspace](../../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* In addition, the following [tenant switches](../../admin/about-tenant-settings.md) must be enabled from the Admin portal:
  * [Users can create Fabric items](../../admin/fabric-switch.md)

  These switches can be enabled by the tenant admin, capacity admin, or workspace admin, depending on your [organization's settings](../../admin/delegate-settings.md).

## Create a variable library item

You can create a variable library item from the Fabric home page or from inside your workspace.

### [From home page](#tab/home-page)

1. From the side navigation bar, select **Create** (If itâ€™s not there, select the three dots -> create)
1. In the Data Factory section, select variable library
1. Name the new variable library. Make sure the name conforms to the required [naming conventions](./understand-variable-library.md#naming-conventions).
