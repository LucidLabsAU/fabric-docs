# Tutorial: Use Variable libraries to customize and share item configurations

This tutorial shows you how to use dynamic content in data pipelines. create a Variable library item and add variables to it so that you can automate different values for different stages of your deployment pipeline.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create a Variable library
> * Add variables to the library
> * Define value-sets for the variables
> * Set rules for the active value-set

## Prerequisites

* A Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
* A [workspace](../../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A workspace with datasources 

## Step 1: Prepare data sources (optional)

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will create a workspace with some source data to use in the Variable library. If you already have a workspace with lakehouse items you want to use, you can skip this step.

1. [Create a workspace](../../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md)

Connect to workspace....

## Step 2: Create a workspace

First, create a workspace that will contain the Variable library item in your workspace to hold the variables. To create the workspace:
