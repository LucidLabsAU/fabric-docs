# Tutorial: Use Variable libraries to customize and share item configurations

This tutorial shows you how to create a Variable library item and add variables to it.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create a Variable library
> * Add variables to the library
> * Define value-sets for the variables
> * Set rules for the active value-set

## Prerequisites

* A Fabric tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
* A [workspace](../../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Open [Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or PowerShell]

<!-- Optional: Open a demo environment - H2

If you want to refer to using Cloud Shell, the
Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, include the instructions as a first step,
after the "Prerequisites" section if prerequisites are included.

Include information about Cloud Shell only if all commands can 
run in Cloud Shell.

Use an include file if one is available.

## [verb] * [noun]

[Introduce a task and its role in completing the process.]

<!-- Required: Tasks to complete in the process - H2

In one or more H2 sections, describe tasks that 
the user completes in the process the tutorial describes.

<!-- Required: Steps to complete the tasks - H2

Use ordered lists to describe how to complete tasks in 
the process. Be consistent when you describe how to
use a method or tool to complete the task.

Code requires specific formatting. Here are a few useful 
examples of commonly used code blocks. Make sure to 
use the interactive functionality when possible.

For the CLI-based or PowerShell-based procedures,
don't use bullets or numbering.

Here is an example of a code block for Java:

```java
cluster = Cluster.build(new File("src/site.yaml")).create();
...
client = cluster.connect();
```

Here's a code block for the Azure CLI:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM 
--image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser 
--admin-password myPassword12
```

This is a code block for Azure PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmContainerGroup -ResourceGroupName 
myResourceGroup -Name mycontainer 
-Image mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:nanoserver 
-OsType Windows -IpAddressType Public
```

## Clean up resources

<!-- Optional: Steps to clean up resources - H2

Provide steps the user takes to clean up resources that
were created to complete the article.
