# Conflict resolution

A conflict occurs when changes are made *to the same item* in both the workspace and the remote git repository. When a conflict occurs, the git status says **Conflict** and both **Commit** and **Update** are disabled until the conflict is resolved.

There are two ways to resolve a conflict:

- [Revert](#revert-to-a-previous-state) either the workspace or the git repository to a previous synced state.
- [Resolve](#resolve-conflict-in-git) the conflict in git.

## Revert to a previous state

You can revert either the workspace or the git branch to last synced state. If you revert the git branch to a previous commit, you can still see the changes made to the unsynced branch. If you revert the workspace, the changes are lost completely.

To revert to the prior synced state, do *one* of the following steps:

- Use the [Undo](./git-get-started.md#commit-changes-to-git) command to return all items in the workspace to their last synced state.
- Revert to the last synced state in git using the `git revert` command in Azure DevOps.

 You can also resolve conflicts by disconnecting and reconnecting the workspace. When you reconnect, [select the direction](./git-integration-process.md#connect-and-sync) you want to sync. Note, however, that this will overwrite all items in the workspace or branch and not just the conflicted ones. It doesn't return the workspace or branch to the last synced state. Rather, it overwrites all the content in one location with the content of the other.

## Resolve conflict in git

If you made numerous changes and donâ€™t want to revert to a previous state, you can try resolving the conflict in the git repo by creating a new branch and syncing it with the current one. **Only a workspace admin can create a new branch**:

1. From the **Source control** pane, check out a new branch using the last synced branch ID shown on bottom of screen

   This step creates a new branch from the conflicted branch using the last synced git state, before changes were made that conflict with your changes. You can see your changes in the **Source control** pane, but there is nothing to update from the git branch.

1. Commit your changes into the new branch. This new branch now has the changes you made to the items connected to an earlier version of the git branch that doesn't conflict with your changes.
1. In git, resolve the conflicts between the original branch and the new branch.
1. In git, merge the new branch into the original branch
1. In Fabric, disconnect and reconnect your workspace to the original branch.
