# Service tags

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

You can use Azure [service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) with Microsoft Fabric to enable an Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI) to allow incoming connections from the Microsoft Fabric. In Azure, a service tag is a defined group of IP addresses that you can configure to be automatically managed, as a group, to minimize the complexity of updates or changes to network security rules. By using service tags with Microsoft Fabric, you can enable a SQL Managed Instance to allow incoming connections from the Microsoft Fabric service.
