# Install the Microsoft Fabric Chargeback app

The *Microsoft Fabric Chargeback* app, also known as the *chargeback app*, is designed to monitor capacity utilization across your Fabric environment. Use this guide to install the app.

## Prerequisites

- You must be an admin of at least one capacity in your organization. Please visit the [Capacity settings](/docs/admin/capacity-settings.md) documentation to learn how to check your admin status.

- Installation of preview applications may be restricted by your organization's tenant policy. If you're unable to install the app, contact your tenant admin and request that they enable the [Install template apps not listed in AppSource](/docs/admin/tenant-settings-index.md) setting in the Power BI Admin portal.

## Install the app

Follow these steps to install the app from Microsoft AppSource.

To avoid throttling due to capacity overutilization, install the app in a workspace with a [Pro license](../power-bi/fundamentals/service-features-license-type#pro-license).

    * **Update only workspace content without updating the app**

    Updates the workspace but doesn't update the app. Select this option to update the app's workspace without upgrading the app.

    * **Install another copy of the app into a new workspace**

    Creates a new workspace and installs the new version of the app in this workspace. Select this option if you want to keep the old version of the app with the new one. This option creates another workspace for the new app version and installs the app in the newly created workspace. If you select this option, you'll need to provide a name for the new workspace.

1. Delete the old app.

2. Reinstall the latest version of the app.

3. Update the semantic model credentials.
