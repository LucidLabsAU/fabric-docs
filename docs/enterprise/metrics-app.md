# What is the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app?

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app has been updated to include support for both EM/A and P SKUs.

The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app is designed to provide monitoring capabilities for Microsoft Fabric capacities. Monitoring your capacities is essential for making informed decisions on how to best use your capacity resources. For example, the app can help identify when to scale up your capacity or when to turn on [autoscale](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-auto-scale).

The app is updated often with new features and functionalities and provides the most in-depth information into how your capacities are performing.

## Install the app

You must be a capacity admin to install the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app. Once installed, anyone in the organization with the right permissions can view the app.

To install the app follow the instructions in [Install the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](metrics-app-install.md).

## Considerations and limitations

When using the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app, consider the following limitations.

* In the [Capacity utilization and throttling](metrics-app-overview-page.md#capacity-utilization-and-throttling) visual logarithmic's view, the primary axis seen on the left of the visual, isn't aligned with the secondary axis seen on the right of the visual.

* In the [interactive](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md#interactive-operations) and [background](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md#background-operations) operation tables, the *Throttling(s)* column displays zero when throttling is disabled, even when the capacity is overloaded.

* There's a difference of 0.01-0.05 percent between the *CU %* value in the [Top row visuals](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md#top-row-visuals) *Heartbeat line chart*, and the [interactive](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md#interactive-operations) and [background](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md#background-operations) operations tables *Total CU* values.

* Updates from version 1 to version 1.1 will be installed in a new workspace.

* Sampling may occur while exporting data from the Export Data page. See second and third bullet in [Considerations and limitations](/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-export-data?tabs=powerbi-desktop#considerations-and-limitations).
