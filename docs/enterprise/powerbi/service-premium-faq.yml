  - name: Power BI Premium transition to Microsoft Fabric
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview) is a platform that allows users to get, create, share, and visualize data using an array of tools. Power BI is a visualization tool, and is one of Fabric's experiences. 

      - question: |
          What's happening to Power BI Premium?
        answer: |
          Power BI Premium transitioned to Microsoft Fabric. Power BI Premium is now part of Fabric. You can use Power BI in Fabric alongside all the additional Fabric [experiences](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview#components-of-microsoft-fabric).\\n[!NOTE]\\n* You can share content with [Free users](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#per-user-licenses) only if you have an F64 SKU or a higher SKU.\\n* Power BI [Report Server](../report-server/get-started.md) isn't available for Fabric.

      - question: |
          Can I use Power BI without Fabric?
        answer: |
          Yes. To use Power BI without Fabric, disable the *Users can create Fabric items* [tenant switch](/fabric/admin/fabric-switch#enable-for-your-tenant).

      - question: |
          Can I buy Power BI Premium?
        answer: |
          No. Power BI Premium resides on a P SKU. P SKUs are no longer available for purchase. To use the Power BI features, you need to buy an F SKU. Purchasing an F SKU allows you to use all the Fabric features, as well as the Power BI Premium features.

      - question: |
          How do I buy Microsoft Fabric?
        answer: |
          To buy Fabric, start with the [Microsoft Fabric pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/) page. 

      - question: |
          How do I renew a P SKU?
        answer: |
          At the time of your next contract renewal, speak with your Microsoft representative about renewing your contract using an F SKU instead of your P-SKU.

      - question: |
          I'm using Power BI Premium, how does the the transition impact me?
        answer: |
          You can buy P SKUs until your agreement with Microsoft ends. However, you'll need to replace all your P SKUs with F SKUs.

      - question: |
          How do I migrate my Power BI Premium content to Fabric?
        answer: |
          To transfer your content to Fabric, you need to reassign your workspaces to the new Fabric capacity. Workspaces can be assigned to a new capacity in the [admin portal]( ../enterprise/service-admin-premium-manage.md#assign-from-the-admin-portal) or the [workspace pane]( /fabric/get-started/workspaces#license-mode).

      - question: |
          Is Power BI Embedded included with Fabric's F SKUs?
        answer: |
          Yes, when you buy an F SKU you also get Power BI Embedded.        

      - question: |
          How do P SKUs compare to F SKUs?
        answer: |
          Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) indicate how much compute power your [capacity](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity) has. You can find a comparison between P and F SKUs in the [Capacity license](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity-license) section.              

      - question: |
          How can I estimate which F SKU to buy? 
        answer: |
          To estimate the size of the capacity you need, work with your Microsoft account representatives who can recommend which SKU to buy, according to your current consumption. You can also use a [Fabric trial]( /fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to measure your capacity consumption. The [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app]( /fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) can help your analyze your capacity’s consumption.  

      - question: |
          Do I need a Pro license with Fabric? 
        answer: |
          Power BI report authors and consumers need a Power BI Pro license. With an F64 or higher SKUs, users can view content with a Microsoft Fabric free license if the content is hosted in the capacity. Fabric items that are not Power BI items, don’t require a Pro license. [Per user licenses](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#per-user-licenses) has more information about per user licenses in Fabric.

      - question: |
          Power BI Premium
        answer: |
          This section addresses questions and answers for Power BI Premium. 

      - question: |
          How can I control the costs of autoscaling?
        answer: |
          Autoscaling is an optional feature of Power BI Premium, and is subject to two limits, each if which is configured by Power BI administrators:
          
          * **Proactive limit** - a proactive limit sets the rate of expenses that Autoscale can generate, by limiting the number of autoscale v-cores a capacity can use. For example, by setting a maximum autoscale of v-cores to one v-core, you ensure that the maximum charge you can incur is 30 days of autoscaling with one v-core.
          
          * **Reactive limit** - you can also set a reactive limit to the cost for autoscaling, by setting an expenditure limit on the Azure subscription used with autoscale. To set a reactive limit, you'll need to do the following:
          
            * Set an [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) to restrict the resource group to resources of type `microsoft.powerbidedicated/autoscalevcores` only.

            * Create an [Action Group](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) within your [Azure budget](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets) which calls a custom Azure PowerShell Runbook to get and delete all resources in the resource group.
          
      - question: |
          How does resource utilization cause Premium to autoscale?
        answer: |
          Power BI Premium evaluates your level of utilization by aggregating utilization records every 30 seconds. Each evaluation is composed of two different aggregations: *Interactive utilization* and *background utilization*. 
          
          *Interactive utilization* is evaluated by considering all the interactive operations that completed on or near the current half-minute evaluation cycle.
          
          *Background utilization* is evaluated by considering all the background operations that completed during the past twenty-four hours, where each background operation contributes only 1/2880 of its total CPU cost (there are 2880 evaluation cycles in each 24-hour period).
          
          A capacity consists of a defined number of v-cores. The [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics](/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) app tracks the utilization of your capacity v-cores. The CPU usage reported in the app drives the need to autoscale.
          
          If you have a P1 subscription with eight v-cores, each evaluation cycle quota is 240 (8 × 30) seconds of CPU utilization. If the sum of both utilizations exceeds the total v-quota in your capacity, your capacity will autoscale using an additional v-core for the next 24 hours.
          
          Autoscale always looks at your current capacity size to evaluate how much resource you use. If you have already autoscaled using one v-core, your maximum capacity is now at 270 (240 + 1 × 30) seconds of CPU time in an evaluation cycle.
          
          Autoscale always makes sure that no single interactive operation can consume all of your capacity, and you must have two or more interactive operations taking place in a single evaluation cycle to initiate autoscale.
          
      - question: |
          What happens to traffic during overload if I don't autoscale?
        answer: |
          During overload, if you don't autoscale [throttling](/fabric/enterprise/throttling) is applied.

      - question: |
          How is the overload score calculated?
        answer: |
          Overload events that take place in the middle of the day are likely to affect many users. Overload events that take place in the middle of the night will probably affect only a handful of users. The overload score is designed to help you differentiate between these two overload events, so that you can single out the Power BI items (such as reports and datasets) that most impact your users.

          The overload score is calculated in two steps:

          1. The amount of CPU seconds belonging to interactive queries affected by an overload event is summed.

          2. The value form step 1 is multiplied by the count of interactive operations that were affected by throttling.

      - question: |
          How can I use my utilization data to predict my capacity needs?
        answer: |
          Your metrics report dataset retains 30 to 45 days of data. You can use the report to indicate how close you're to your capacity's maximum resources, and if you save monthly snapshots, you can compare them to indicate trends of growth and extrapolate the rate in which you'll arrive at 100% utilization of your resources.

      - question: |
          How can my utilization data inform me I should turn on autoscale?
        answer: |
          Utilization data doesn't currently indicate whether requests were throttled due to capacity being in *interactive request delay* mode. The information will be added to the utilization app so admins can determine whether users experienced delays, and to what extent the delays are due to overload without autoscaling.

      - question: |
          How can I get notified that I'm approaching my max capacity?
        answer: |
          The **Capacity management** page in the Power BI admin portal has a utilization notification checkbox. Users can choose the threshold at which an alert will be triggered (default is 80%) and the email address to which utilization alerts should be sent.

      - question: |
          How much data is Power BI storing? How can I retain more?
        answer: |
          The Power BI service stores over 90 days of utilization data. Users who need longer data retention can use Bring Your Own Log Analytics (BYOLA) to store more utilization data. 

      - question: |
          How do I get visibility into resources of Premium beyond CPU time?
        answer: |
          Customers don't have visibility through utilization data to the memory footprint of their operations, and can't know ahead of time whether any of their operations is subject to failures.

      - question: |
          How do I use utilization data to perform chargebacks?
        answer: |
          On the left side of the utilization report, a bar chart visual displays utilization information between workspaces for the time span of the report. The bar chart visual can be used for chargebacks, providing each workspace represents a different business unit, cost center, or other entity to which chargebacks can apply.

      - question: |
          How does Power BI report CPU usage? 
        answer: |
          When you buy a capacity, you get a predefined number of v-cores, as listed in [Capacities and SKUs](service-premium-what-is.md#capacities-and-skus).
          
          By displaying your capacity's CPU usage levels, the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics](/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) app helps you understand how your capacity is performing. To provide a simple way of measuring your capacity's performance, the app reports CPU usage for the number of v-cores your capacity has. Power BI makes throttling and autoscale decisions based on the data that's displayed in the app.
