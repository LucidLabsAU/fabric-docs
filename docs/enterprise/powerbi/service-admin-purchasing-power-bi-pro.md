# Purchase and assign Power BI paid user licenses

> [!IMPORTANT]
>This article is for administrators and explains how to purchase Power BI paid user licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After purchasing, you assign licenses to users from either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium Per User (PPU) are individual user licenses that let users read and interact with reports and dashboards that others publish to the Power BI service. Users with a paid license can share content and collaborate with other Pro or PPU users. Only paid users can publish or share content with other users or use content that's created by others, unless a Power BI Premium capacity hosts that content. For more information about the available types of licenses and subscriptions, see [Power BI licensing in your organization](service-admin-licensing-organization.md).


## Prerequisites

- To purchase and assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you must be a member of the [Global or Billing admin role in Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/about-office-365-admin-roles-da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d).
- To assign licenses in the Azure portal, you must be an owner of the Azure subscription that Power BI uses for Microsoft Entra lookups.
