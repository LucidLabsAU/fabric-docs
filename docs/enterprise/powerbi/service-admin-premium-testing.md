# Purchase Power BI Premium for testing

This article describes how to purchase Power BI Premium A SKUs for testing scenarios, and for cases where you don't have the permissions necessary to purchase P SKUs (Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role or Billing Administrator role). A SKUs require no time commitment, and are billed hourly. You purchase A SKUs in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

For more information about Power BI Premium, see [What is Power BI Premium?](service-premium-gen2-what-is.md). For current pricing and planning information, see the [Power BI pricing page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/). Content creators still need a [Power BI Pro license](service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro.md), even if your organization uses Power BI Premium. Make sure to purchase at least one Power BI Pro license for your organization. With A SKUs, _all users_ who consume content also require Pro licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> If a Premium subscription expires, you have 30 days of full access to your capacity. After that, your content reverts to a shared capacity. Models that are greater than 1 GB aren't supported in shared capacity.

## Purchase A SKUs for testing and other scenarios

A SKUs are available through the Azure Power BI Embedded service. You can use A SKUs in the following ways:

- Enable embedding of Power BI in third party applications. For more information, see [Power BI Embedded](../developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi.md).

- Test Premium functionality before you buy a P SKU.

- Create development and test environments with a production environment that uses P SKUs.

- Purchase Power BI Premium even though you don't have a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role or Billing Administrator role.

> [!NOTE]
> If you purchase an A4 or higher SKU, you can take advantage of all Premium features except for unlimited sharing of content. With A SKUs, _all users_ who consume content require Pro licenses.

Follow these steps to purchase A SKUs in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that has at least capacity admin permissions in Power BI.

1. Search for _Power BI Embedded_ and select the service in the search results.

1. On the **Power BI Embedded** create screen, specify the following:

    - The **Subscription** in which to create the Power BI Embedded service.

    - The physical **Location** in which to create the resource group that contains the service. For better performance, this location should be close to the location of your Azure Active Directory tenant for Power BI.

    - An existing **Resource group** to use, or create a new one as shown in the example.

    - The **Power BI capacity administrator**. The capacity admin must be a member user or a service principal in your Azure AD tenant.
