# Close your Power BI account

If you don't want to use Power BI any longer, you can close your Power BI account.  After you close your account, you can't sign in to Power BI. Also, as it states in the data retention policy in the [Power BI Service Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/), Power BI deletes any customer data you uploaded or created.

## Individual Power BI users

If you signed up for Power BI as an individual, you can close your account from the **Settings** screen.

1. In Power BI, select the gear in the upper right, then select **Settings**.

1. On the **General** tab, select **Close Account**.

    You should see a confirmation that Power BI closed your account. You can reopen your account from here if necessary.

## Managed users

If your organization signed you up for Power BI, contact your admin. Ask them to unassign the license from your account.
