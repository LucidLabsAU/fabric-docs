# Sign up for Power BI with a new Microsoft 365 trial

This article describes an alternative way to sign up for the Power BI service if you don't already have a work or school email account and don't already have an account that works with Microsoft 365.

You're unable to sign up for Power BI with your personal email address. You can still try out Power BI and Fabric with a Microsoft 365 trial. During the Microsoft 365 trial sign-up process, you create an "onmicrosoft" email work account. Use that new work account to sign up for the Power BI service and get a Fabric free or Power BI Pro license. Continue to use that work account even after you cancel your Microsoft 365 trial.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a credit or debit card when you sign up for the Microsoft 365 free trial. At the end of your free trial period, your trial subscription is automatically converted to a paid subscription. Your card isn't billed until the trial period ends.

## Sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial

There are many trials available on the Microsoft 365 site at any time. Look for the **Try free for one month** buttons.

Sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial [on the Microsoft 365 web site](.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office365-plans-and-pricing). If you don't already have an account, Microsoft walks you through the steps to create one. 

1. On one of the Microsoft 365 options, select **Try for free**.
1. Follow the prompts to set up your trial. Enter the number of users, then your email address, and select **Next**.  

    If you need a new email address, select **Set up account**.

1. After completing the sign-up process, Microsoft displays your new user name and domain, for example, *you@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com*. Create a password, and then select **Next**.

You used your new business account to sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365. If you signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, your trial includes Power BI Pro. If you signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Standard, use your new business account to [sign up for a trial of the Power BI service as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-purchase-for-power-bi.md).

## Important considerations

If you have any issues when you sign in with the new account credentials, try using a private browser session.

When you use this sign-up method, you create a new organizational tenant, and you become the User and Billing administrator of the tenant. For more information, see [What is Power BI administration](../admin/service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md). You can add new users to your tenant, then share with them, as described in the [Microsoft 365 admin documentation](https://support.office.com/article/Add-users-individually-to-Office-365---Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec).

If you'd like to use email with this new business account, enable email for your new account in Outlook. Alternatively, you can access your onmicrosoft email by going to the [Microsoft account sign-in page](https://account.microsoft.com/) and entering your email address and password. Use the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://portal.office.com) and select **Admin** to update the email or add an alternate email address.
