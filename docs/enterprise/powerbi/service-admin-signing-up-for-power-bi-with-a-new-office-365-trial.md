# Sign up for Power BI with a new Microsoft 365 Trial

This article describes an alternative way to sign up for the Power BI service if you don't already have a work or school email account.

If you're having problems signing up for Power BI with your email address, first make sure it's an [email address that can be used with Power BI](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md#supported-email-addresses). If that's not successful, sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial and create a work account. Then, use that new work account to sign up for the Power BI service. You can use Power BI even after the Microsoft 365 trial expires.

## Sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial of Office

Sign up for a Microsoft 365 trial [on the Microsoft 365 web site](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans). If you don't already have an account, Microsoft walks you through the steps to create one. Since commercial email accounts, such as Hotmail and Gmail don't work with Microsoft 365, you'll create a new Microsoft account.  That email account looks something like *zalan\@onmicrosoft.com*.

You used your new business account to sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365. If you signed up for Microsoft 365 E5, your trial includes Power BI Pro. If you signed up for Microsoft 365 E3, use your new business account to [sign up for a trial of the Power BI service as an individual](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md).

## Important considerations

If you have any issues when you sign in with the new account credentials, try using a private browser session.

When you use this sign-up method, you create a new organizational tenant, and you become the User administrator of the tenant. For more information, see [What is Power BI administration](../admin/service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization.md). You can add new users to your tenant, then share with them, as described in the [Microsoft 365 admin documentation](https://support.office.com/article/Add-users-individually-to-Office-365---Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec).

If you'd like to use email with this new business account, enable email for your new account in Outlook. Alternatively, you can access your onmicrosoft email by going to the [Microsoft account sign-in page](https://account.microsoft.com/) and entering your email address and password. If you have admin permissions, use the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://portal.office.com) and select **Admin** to update the email or add an alternate email address
