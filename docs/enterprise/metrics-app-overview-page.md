# Understand the metrics app overview page

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app's overview page provides an overview of your capacity's performance. It's divided into the three visuals listed below. The top two visuals include a ribbon chart and a line and stacked column chart, and the bottom visual is a matrix table.

At the top of each page, the **Capacity Name** field allows you to select the capacity the app shows results for.

## Multi metric ribbon chart

A ribbon chart that provides an hourly view of your capacity's usage. Drill down to a specific day to identify daily patterns. Selecting each stacked column will filter the main matrix and the other visuals according to your selection.

The Multi metric column ribbon displays the four values listed below. It shows the top results for these values per item during the past two weeks.

* **CU** - Capacity Units (CU) processing time in seconds.

* **Duration** - Processing time in seconds.

* **Operations** - The number of operations that took place.

* **Users** - The number of users that performed operations.

## Capacity utilization and throttling

Displays usage and throttling for the selected capacity. Use the tabs at the top of the visual to toggle how the visual is displayed.

### Utilization  

Displays CU usage over time. Use the tabs at the top right corner of the visual to toggle how the visual is displayed.

* **Linear** - Display the information using a linear scale that starts at 0 percent.

* **Logarithmic** - Display the information using a logarithmic scale that depends on your CUs consumption.

The utilization chart displays the following elements:

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft Fabric is in preview. Some workloads within Fabric are in preview and others are not. Preview workloads are not billable and their consumption is available from the *Background non-billable* and *Interactive non-billable* columns.

* **Background %** - Blue columns represent the percent of CU consumption used during background operations in a 30 second period. This column refers to billable operations.
    
    [*Background*](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations#background-operations) operations cover backend processes that are not directly triggered by users, such as data refreshes.

* **Interactive %** - Red columns represent the percent of CU consumption used during interactive operations in a 30 second period. This column refers to billable operations.

    [*Interactive*](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations#interactive-operations) operations cover a wide range of resources triggered by users. These operations are associated with interactive page loads.

* **Background non-billable %** - Baby blue columns represent the percent of CU consumption used during preview workloads background operations in a 30 second period. During public preview, this refers to operations in workloads that are not billable.

* **Interactive non-billable %** - Green columns represent the percent of CU consumption used during preview workloads interactive operations in a 30 second period. This column refers to operations that are performed in non-preview workloads. During public preview, this refers to operations in workloads that are not billable.

* **Autoscale CU % Limit** - An orange dotted line that shows the percent of CU consumption for autoscaled capacities. The line represents timepoints where the capacity is overloaded.

* **CU % Limit** - A grey dotted line that shows the threshold of the allowed percent of CU consumption for the selected capacity. Columns that stretch above this line, represent timepoints where the capacity is overloaded.


### Throttling

Displays delay and rejection over time. Use the tabs at the top right corner of the visual to toggle how the visual is displayed. 

* **Linear** - Display the information using a linear scale that starts at 0 percent.

* **Logarithmic** - Display the information using a logarithmic scale that depends on your CUs consumption.

Use the tabs at the top of the visual to toggle between interactive delay, interactive rejection and background rejection. Timepoints with a value that's above 100% are rendered with darker color.

The throttling chart displays the following elements:

  * **Interactive delay** - Billable interactive operations are delayed if the value is above 100%.
  
  * **Interactive rejection** - Billable interactive operations are rejected if the value is above 100%.

  * **Background rejection** - Billable background operations are rejected if the value is above 100%.

### Overages 
  
Displays the *add*, *burndown* and *cumulative* carryforward over time. Carryforward only takes into account billable operations.

The overages chart displays the following elements:

  * **Add %** - Green columns represent the carryforward percent added during the current 30 second period.
  
  * **Burndown %** - Blue columns represent the carryforward percent burned down for the current 30 second period.
  
  * **Cumulative %** - Red line represent the cumulative carryforward percent for the current 30 second period. 
  

Once you select a column in the chart, you can use the *Explore* button to drill through to the [timepoint](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md) page.

Filters applied to the page in the [Multi metric ribbon chart](#multi-metric-ribbon-chart), affect this chart's display as follows:

* *No filters applied* - Columns display the peak timepoint per hour.

* *Filters are applied* - The visuals displays every 30 second timepoint.

>[!NOTE]
>Peak is calculated as the highest number of seconds from both [*interactive* and *background*](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations) operations.

To access the [Timepoint](metrics-app-timepoint-page.md) page from this visual, select a timepoint you want to explore and then select **Explore**.

>[!NOTE]
>Non billable usage does not drain capacity or lead to throttling or auto scale. 


## Matrix by item and operation

A matrix table that displays metrics for each item on the capacity. To gain a better understanding of your capacity's performance, you can sort this table according to the parameters listed below. The colors in the table represent your *performance delta*.

User can hover over any value in the visual to see operation level data. User can also filter the visual with item kind slicer and add or remove columns using optional columns slicer.

* **Items** - A list of items active during the selected period of time. The item name is a string with the syntax: `workspace name \ item type \ item name`. You can expand each entry to show the various operations (such as queries and refreshes) the item performed.

* **CU (s)** - Capacity Units (CU) processing time in seconds. Sort to view the top CUs that processed items over the past two weeks.

* **Duration (s)** - Processing time in seconds. Sort to view the items that needed the longest processing time during the past two weeks.

* **Users** - The number of users that used the item.

* **Item Size** - The amount of memory an item needs. Sort to view the items that have the largest memory footprint.

* **Overloaded minutes** - Displays a sum of 30 seconds increments where overloading occurred at least once. Sort to view the items that were affected the most due to overload penalty.

* **Performance delta** - Displays the performance effect on the items. The number represents the percent of change from seven days ago. For example, 20 suggests that there's a 20% improvement today, compared with the same metric taken a week ago.

    The colors in the matrix represent your *performance delta*:
    * *No color* - A value higher than -10
    * *Orange* - A value between -10 and -25
    * *Red* - A value lower than -25

    To create the *performance delta* Microsoft Fabric calculates an hourly average for all the fast operations that take under 200 milliseconds to complete. The hourly value is used as a slow moving average over the last seven days (168 hours). The slow moving average is then compared to the average between the most recent data point, and a data point from seven days ago. The *performance delta* indicates the difference between these two averages.

    You can use the *performance delta* value to assess whether the average performance of your items improved or worsened over the past week. The higher the value is, the better the performance is likely to be. A value close to zero indicates that not much has changed, and a negative value suggests that the average performance of your items got worse over the past week.

    Sorting the matrix by the *performance delta* column helps identify datasets that have had the biggest change in their performance. During your investigation, don't forget to consider the *CU (s)* and number of *Users*. The *performance delta* value is a good indicator when it comes to Microsoft Fabric items that have a high CU utilization because they're heavily used or run many operations. However, small datasets with little CU activity may not reflect a true picture, as they can easily show large positive or negative values.

* **Billing type** - Displays information if the item is billable or not.

    * **Billable** - Indicates that operations for this item are billable.

    * **Non-Billable**  - Indicates that operations for this item are non-billable.

    * **Both** - There are two scenarios when item can have both as billable type:
        - If item has both billable and non-billable operations
        - If item has operations that are in transition period from non-billable to billable.
