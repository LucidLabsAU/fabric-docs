# Limitations in SQL database in Microsoft Fabric (preview)

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-sqldb](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric-sqldb.md)]

Current limitations in the SQL database in Fabric are listed in this page. This page is subject to change.

These limitations apply to SQL database in Fabric only. For the warehouse and SQL analytics endpoint items in Fabric Data Warehouse, see [Limitations of Fabric Data Warehouse](../../data-warehouse/limitations.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Database level limitations

- SQL database in Fabric does not support Change Data Capture (CDC) or Azure Synapse Link for SQL.
- SQL Audit is not currently supported in SQL database in Fabric.
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is not supported. SQL database in Fabric uses storage encryption with service-managed keys to protect all customer data at rest. Customer-managed keys are not supported.

## Table level  

- A table primary key cannot be one of these data types: **hierarchyid**, **sql_variant**, **timestamp**.
- If one or more columns in the table is of type Large Binary Object (LOB) with a size > 1 MB, the column data is truncated to size of 1 MB in Fabric OneLake.
- Currently, tables cannot be in-memory tables.
- Full-text indexing is not supported and cannot be created in SQL database in Microsoft Fabric.
- The following table-level data definition language (DDL) operations aren't allowed:
    - Switch/Split/Merge partition
    - Partition compression

## Column level

- Column names for a SQL table cannot contain spaces nor the following characters: `,` `;` `{` `}` `(` `)` `\n` `\t` `=`.

### SQL analytics endpoint limitationsâ€¯ 

- The SQL analytics endpoint of the SQL database in Fabric works just like the [Lakehouse SQL analytics endpoint](../../data-engineering/lakehouse-overview.md#lakehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint). It is the same read-only experience.
