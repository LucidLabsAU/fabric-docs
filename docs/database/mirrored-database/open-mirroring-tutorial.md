# Tutorial: Configure Microsoft Fabric open mirrored databases

In this tutorial, you configure an Open mirrored database in Fabric. This example guides you to create a new open mirrored database and learn how to land data into the landing zone. You'll get proficient with the concepts of open mirroring in Microsoft Fabric.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

- You need an existing capacity for Fabric. If you don't, [start a Fabric trial](../../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
    - The Fabric capacity needs to be active and running. A paused or deleted capacity will affect Mirroring and no data will be replicated.
- During the current preview, the ability to create an open mirrored database via the Fabric portal is not available in all Fabric capacity regions.

## Create a mirrored database

In this section, we provide a brief overview of how to create a new open mirrored database in the Fabric portal. Alternatively, you could use the [Create mirrored database REST API](mirrored-database-rest-api.md#create-mirrored-database) together with the JSON definition example of open mirroring for creation.

1. Use an existing workspace or create a new workspace. From your workspace, navigate to the **Create** hub. Select **Create**.
1. Locate and select the **Mirrored Database** card.
1. Enter a name for the new mirrored database.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Once an Open mirrored database is created via the user interface, the mirroring process is ready. Review the **Home** page for the new mirrored database item. Locate the **Landing zone** URL is in the details section of the mirrored database home page.

## Write change data into the landing zone

Your application can now write initial load and incremental change data into the landing zone.

- Follow the [Connecting to Microsoft OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-access-api.md) to authorize and write to the mirrored database landing zone in OneLake.
- Review the [Open mirroring landing zone requirements and format](open-mirroring-landing-zone-format.md) specifications.

## Start mirroring process

1. The **Configure mirroring** screen allows you to mirror all data in the database, by default.
    - **Mirror all data** means that any new tables created after Mirroring is started will be mirrored.
    - Optionally, choose only certain objects to mirror. Disable the **Mirror all data** option, then select individual tables from your database.
    For this tutorial, we select the **Mirror all data** option.
1. Select **Mirror database**. Mirroring begins.
1. Wait for 2-5 minutes. Then, select **Monitor replication** to see the status.
1. After a few minutes, the status should change to *Running*, which means the tables are being synchronized.
   If you don't see the tables and the corresponding replication status, wait a few seconds and then refresh the panel.
1. When they have finished the initial copying of the tables, a date appears in the **Last refresh** column.
1. Now that your data is up and running, there are various analytics scenarios available across all of Fabric.

## Monitor Fabric Mirroring

Once mirroring is configured, you're directed to the **Mirroring Status** page. Here, you can monitor the current state of replication.

For more information and details on the replication states, see [Monitor Fabric mirrored database replication](monitor.md).
