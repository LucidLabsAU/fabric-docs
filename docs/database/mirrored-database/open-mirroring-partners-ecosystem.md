# Open mirroring (preview) partner ecosystem

[Open mirroring in Microsoft Fabric (Preview)](open-mirroring.md) is designed to be extensible, customizable, and open. It's a powerful feature that extends Mirroring in Fabric based on open Delta Lake table format. This capability enables any data providers to write change data directly into a mirrored database item in Microsoft Fabric.

The following are the open mirroring partners who have already built solutions to integrate with Microsoft Fabric.

This page will be updated during the current preview.

## Oracle GoldenGate 23ai

Oracle GoldenGate 23ai integration into Microsoft Fabric via open mirroring. Now, any supported Oracle GoldenGate source including Oracle Database@Azure can replicate data into Mirrored Database in Microsoft Fabric. This powerful combination unlocks real-time data integration, continuously synchronizing data across your hybrid and multicloud environments. Mirrored Database in Microsoft Fabric as a destination is available through the GoldenGate for Distributed Applications and Analytics 23ai product.

## Striim

SQL2Fabric-Mirroring is a Striim solution that reads data from SQL Server and writes it to Microsoft Fabric's mirroring landing zone in Delta-Parquet format. Microsoft's Fabric replication service frequently picks up these files and replicates the file contents into Fabric data warehouse tables.

## MongoDB

MongoDB integrated with open mirroring for a solution to bring operational data from MongoDB Atlas to Microsoft Fabric for Big data analytics, AI and BI, combining it with the rest of the data estate of the enterprise. Once mirroring is enabled for a MongoDB Atlas collection, the corresponding table in OneLake is kept in sync with the changes in source MongoDB Atlas collection, unlocking opportunities of varied analytics and AI and BI in near real-time.
