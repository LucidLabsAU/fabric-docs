    - question: |
        Is there a staging or landing zone for Snowflake? If so, is it outside of OneLake?
      answer: 
        For Snowflake, we do use a landing zone to store both the snapshot and change data into OneLake, to improve performance as we're converting these files in the landing zones into delta vertiparquet.
    - question: |
        How long does the initial replication take?
      answer: 
        It depends on the size of the data and the data provider or application that you use to write data into open mirroring.
    - question: |
        How long does it take to replicate data once it is in the landing zone?
      answer: 
        Near real-time latency.
    - question: |
        How do I manage connections?
      answer: 
        There's no connection to manage in open mirroring.
    - question: |
        Can Power BI reports on mirrored data use direct lake mode?
      answer: 
        Yes, since tables are all v-ordered delta tables.
    - question: |
        What are the replication statuses?
      answer: 
        See [Monitor Fabric Mirror replication](monitor.md).
