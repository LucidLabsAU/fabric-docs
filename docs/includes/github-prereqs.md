To integrate Git with your Microsoft Fabric workspace, you need to set up the following prerequisites in both Azure DevOps and Fabric.

### Azure DevOps prerequisites

- An active Azure account registered to the same user that is using the Fabric workspace. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/).
- Access to an existing repository.

### Fabric prerequisites

To access the Git integration feature, you need one of the following:

- [Power BI Premium license](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-what-is). Your Power BI premium license still works for all Power BI features.
- [Fabric capacity](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity-and-skus). A Fabric capacity is required to use all supported Fabric items.

In addition, your organizationâ€™s administrator has to [enable the Fabric switch](/fabric/admin/fabric-switch). If this switch is disabled, contact your administrator.
