# Smoothing and throttling in Fabric Data Warehousing

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

This article details the concepts of smoothing and throttling in workloads using [!INCLUDE [fabricdw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and [!INCLUDE [fabricse](includes/fabric-se.md)] in Microsoft Fabric.

This article is specific to data warehousing workloads in Microsoft Fabric. For all Fabric workloads, visit [Throttling in Microsoft Fabric](../enterprise/throttling.md).

## Compute capacity

Capacity forms the foundation in Microsoft Fabric and provides the computing power that drives all Fabric workload experiences. Based on the Capacity SKU purchased, you're entitled to a set of Capacity Units (CUs) that are shared across Fabric. You can review the CUs for each SKU at [Capacity and SKUs](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity-license).

## Smoothing

Capacities have periods where they're under-utilized (idle) and over-utilized (peak). When a capacity is running multiple jobs, a sudden spike in compute demand may be generated that exceeds the limits of a purchased capacity.

Smoothing offers relief for customers who create sudden spikes during their peak times while they have a lot of idle capacity that is unused. Smoothing simplifies capacity management by spreading the evaluation of compute to ensure that customer jobs run smoothly and efficiently.

Smoothing won't affect execution time. It helps streamline capacity management by allowing customers to size your capacity based on average, rather than peak usage.

- **For interactive jobs run by users:** capacity consumption is typically smoothed over a minimum of 5 minutes, or longer, to reduce short-term temporal spikes.

- **For scheduled, or background jobs:**Â capacity consumption is spread over 24 hours, eliminating the concern for job scheduling or contention.

## Operation classification for Fabric data warehousing

In general, similar to Power BI, [operations are classified either as ](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations#operation-list)*[interactive](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations#operation-list)* or *[background](/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-interactive-background-operations#operation-list)*.

Most [operations](usage-reporting.md#warehouse-operation-categories) in the **Warehouse** category are reported as *background* to take advantage of 24-hour smoothing of activity to allow for the most flexible usage patterns. With 24-hour smoothing, operations can run simultaneously without causing any spikes at any time during the day. Customers get the benefit of a consistently fast performance without having to worry about tiny spikes in their workload. Thus, classifying all data warehousing as *background* prevents peaks of CU utilization from triggering throttling too quickly.

## Throttling

Throttling occurs when a customer's capacity consumes more CPU resources than what was purchased. After consumption is smoothed, capacity throttling policies will be checked based on the amount of future capacity consumed. This results in a degraded end-user experience. When a capacity enters a throttled state, it only affects operations that are requested after the capacity has begun throttling. 

Throttling policies are applied at a capacity level, meaning that while one capacity, or set of workspaces, may be experiencing reduced performance due to being overloaded, other capacities may continue running normally.

The four capacity throttling policies for Microsoft Fabric:

|Future Smoothed Consumption - Policy Limits|Throttling Policy  |Experience Impact|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|**Usage <= 10 minutes**|Overage protection|Jobs can consume 10 minutes of future capacity use without throttling.|
|**10 minutes < Usage <=60 minutes**|Interactive Delay|User-requested interactive jobs are delayed 20 seconds at submission. |
|**60 minutes < Usage <= 24 hours**|Interactive Rejection|User requested interactive type jobs are rejected.|
|**Usage > 24 hours**|Background Rejection|All new jobs are rejected from execution. This is the category for most **Warehouse** operations.|

All Warehouse and SQL Endpoint operations follow "Background Rejection" policy, and as a result experience operation rejection only after over-utilization averaged over a 24-hour period.

### Throttling considerations

- Any inflight operations including long-running queries, stored procedures, batches won't get throttled mid-way. Throttling policies are applicable to the next operation after consumption is smoothed.
- Warehouse operations are _background_ except for scenarios which involves Modeling operations (such as creating a measure, adding or removing tables from default dataset, visualize results etc. ) or creating/updating Power BI datasets (including default dataset) or reports. These operations will continue to follow "Interactive Rejection" policy.
- Just like most **Warehouse** operations, dynamic management views (DMVs) are also classified as *background* and covered by the "Background Rejection" policy. Even though DMVs are not available, capacity admins can go to [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) to understand the root cause.
- If you attempt to issue a T-SQL query when the "Background Rejection" policy is enabled, you may see error message: `Your request was rejected due to resource constraints. Try again later`.
- If you attempt to connect to a warehouse via SQL connection string when the "Background Rejection" policy is enabled, you may see error message: `Your request was rejected due to resource constraints. Try again later (Microsoft SQL Server Server, Error: 18456)`.

## Best practices to recover from overload situations

A capacity administrator can recover from a throttling situation by:

- Upgrade the capacity to a higher SKU to raise capacity limit.
- [Identify contributors to peak activity](how-to-observe-utilization.md) and work with high-load project owners to optimize requests by T-SQL query optimization processes or redistributing tasks across other capacities.
    - Reschedule batch activities to avoid overlapping or concurrency with other requests. For example, spread out scheduled data pipelines in Data Engineering during overnight processing.
- Wait until the overload state is over before issuing new requests.
- Capacity admins can configure proactive [alerts](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-premium-capacity-notifications) and be notified before a capacity gets throttled.

## Monitor overload information with Fabric Capacity Metrics App

Capacity administrators can view overload information and drilldown further via [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](../enterprise/metrics-app.md).

### Utilization tab

This screenshot shows when the "Autoscale %" (the yellow line) was enabled to prevent throttling of peak utilization. When the "Interactive %" (red line) exceeded the CU limit, throttling policies were in effect. This example doesn't indicate any throttling of _background_ operations in capacity.

### Throttling tab

To monitor and analyze throttling policies, a throttling tab is added to the usage graph. With this, capacity admins can easily observe future usage as a percentage of each limit, and even drill down to specific workloads that contributed to an overage. For more information, refer to [Throttling in the Metrics App](../enterprise/metrics-app-overview-page.md#throttling).

Utilization exceeding the 100% line is potentially subject to throttling in the "Background Rejection" policy.

### Overages Tab

The **Overages** tab provides a visual history of any overutilization of capacity, including carry forward, cumulative, and burndown of utilization. For more information, refer to [Throttling in Microsoft Fabric](../enterprise/throttling.md) and [Overages in the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app](../enterprise/metrics-app-overview-page.md#overages).
