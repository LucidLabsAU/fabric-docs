# Create a sample Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

This article describes how to get started with sample [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] using the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal, including creation and consumption of the warehouse.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## How to create a warehouse sample

In this section, we walk you through two distinct experiences available for creating a sample [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] from scratch.

### Create a warehouse sample using the Home hub

1. The first hub in the left navigation menus is the **Home** hub. You can start creating your warehouse sample from the **Home** hub by selecting the **Warehouse sample** card under the **New** section.

2. Provide the name for your sample warehouse and select **Create**.

3. The create action creates a new [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and start loading sample data into it. The data loading takes few seconds to complete.

   :::image type="content" source="media\create-warehouse-sample\loading-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the loading sample data into Warehouse." lightbox="media\create-warehouse-sample\loading-sample-data.png":::

4. On completion of loading sample data, the warehouse opens with data loaded into tables and views to query.

### Load sample data into existing warehouse

For more information on how to create a warehouse, see [Create a Warehouse](create-warehouse.md).

1. Once you have created your warehouse, you can load sample data into warehouse from **Use sample database** card. 

   :::image type="content" source="media\create-warehouse-sample\use-sample-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the Warehouse card in the Create hub." lightbox="media\create-warehouse-sample\use-sample-database.png":::

2. The data loading takes few seconds to complete.

   :::image type="content" source="media\create-warehouse-sample\loading-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the loading sample data into warehouse." lightbox="media\create-warehouse-sample\loading-sample-data.png":::

3. On completion of loading sample data, the warehouse displays data loaded into tables and views to query.

### Sample scripts

```sql

/*************************************************
Get number of trips performed by each medallion
**************************************************/

SELECT 
    M.MedallionID
    ,M.MedallionCode
    ,COUNT(T.TripDistanceMiles) AS TotalTripCount
FROM   
    dbo.Trip AS T
JOIN   
    dbo.Medallion AS M
ON 
    T.MedallionID=M.MedallionID
GROUP BY 
    M.MedallionID
    ,M.MedallionCode

/****************************************************
How many passengers are being picked up on each trip?
*****************************************************/
SELECT
    PassengerCount,
    COUNT(*) AS CountOfTrips
FROM 
    dbo.Trip
WHERE 
    PassengerCount > 0
GROUP BY 
    PassengerCount
ORDER BY 
    PassengerCount

/*********************************************************************************
What is the distribution of trips by hour on working days (non-holiday weekdays)?
*********************************************************************************/
SELECT
    ti.HourlyBucket,
    COUNT(*) AS CountOfTrips
FROM dbo.Trip AS tr
INNER JOIN dbo.Date AS d
    ON tr.DateID = d.DateID
INNER JOIN dbo.Time AS ti
    ON tr.PickupTimeID = ti.TimeID
WHERE
    d.IsWeekday = 1
    AND d.IsHolidayUSA = 0
GROUP BY
    ti.HourlyBucket
ORDER BY
    ti.HourlyBucket
```
