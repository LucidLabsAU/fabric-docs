# Tutorial: Clean up tutorial resources

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Now that you've completed all tutorials, we recommend that you clean up by removing the tutorial workspace. Removing the workspace will help conserve your capacity resources.

> [!CAUTION]
> All content in the workspace will be permanently deleted after a retention period of seven days.

## Remove the workspace

In this task, you'll remove the workspace you created in the first tutorial.

1. Ensure that the workspace you created in the [first tutorial](tutorial-create-workspace.md) is open.

1. In the workspace landing page, select **Workspace settings**.
