# Publish a workload

After you [upload your workload](manage-workload.md) to Microsoft Fabric, you can publish it.

## Publish your workload

1. Sign in to Fabric.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Admin portal**.

1. Select **Workloads**.

1. On the **Public Sample Workload** pane, select the **Publish** tab.

1. In the **Select Version** dropdown list, select the version of the workload to publish.

1. For **Publish to**, select the tenants to publish the workload to.

1. Select **Publish**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to publish to your own tenant, ensure that you first deactivate the workload in the Microsoft Fabric admin portal. For more information, see the steps to [deactivate a workload](manage-workload.md).
