# Upload and manage a workload (preview)

This article describes how to upload and manage a workload to Microsoft Fabric. Workloads enhance the usability of your service within a familiar workspace, eliminating the need to leave the Fabric environment. Fabric workloads increase user engagement and improve your applicationâ€™s discoverability in the Fabric marketplace. The Fabric workspace includes various components, known as Fabric items, which handle storage, analysis, and presentation of your data.

## Prerequisites

To deploy a workload, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A Fabric account with admin permissions.
* The [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/) workload solution that you want to deploy. For information about creating a workload solution, see [QuickStart: Run a workload sample](quickstart-sample.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When DevGateway is connected to the Fabric backend, the developer workload takes precedence over the workload that's activated in the tenant. If you try to create an item in a workspace that's registered in the DevGateway configuration,, the Fabric backend calls your local workload instead of the activated workload.

## Upload a workload

1. Sign in to [Fabric](https://powerbi.com) with an admin account.
