# Localize your workload
Localization is the process of adapting a product to serve different markets be it by changing the language or the content. Localizing your workload enables you to reach a wider audience and provide your customers with the best, most personalized experience. For example, a localized workload is more attractive to a user whose default language isn't English in the Workload Hub.

The following image shows an example of a localized workload in the Workload Hub.

For a Fabric Workload, it involves two aspects -
* Translating text within the iframe, independently of the Fabric shell, using [the Fabric Portal language](#access-the-language-of-the-fabric-portal).
* Enabling the translation of key words that are used in the Fabric shell such as the workload name, item names, workload descriptions and more. These strings are currently found directly in the manifest files (product.json and item.json).
    * For a description of all the strings that are localized, see [Localization Targets](#localization-targets).

## Supported languages
Fabric currently supports the following 44 languages:

You may choose to provide some or all of these languages. The only language that is required is English (US), as that is the default language of Fabric.

## Package structure

First, all strings in the manifest must be replaced with keys. A value for each key is in a separate file.
For example, if your product.json manifest previously started as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "Product",
    "displayName": "Fabric Sample Workload",
    "fullDisplayName": "Fabric Sample Workload",
    "description": "Sample Workload Description",
    "favicon": "assets/briefcase.png",
    "icon": {
      "name": "assets/briefcase.png"
    },
    "homePage": {
...
```

Then, your product.json manifest should now be something like:

```json
{
    "name": "Product",
    "displayName": "Workload_Display_Name",
    "fullDisplayName": "Workload_Display_Name_Full",
    "description": "Workload_Description",
    "favicon": "assets/images/briefcase.png",
    "icon": {
      "name": "assets/images/briefcase.png"
    },
    "homePage": {
        ...
```

In order to support localization, your package must have the following structure:

```
FE/
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    |   └── # the images and icons that were previously under the assets folder directly
    └── locales/
        ├── en-US/
        |   └── translations.json
        ├── es/
        |   └── translations.json
        ├── de/
        |   └── translations.json
        ├── fr/
        |   └── translations.json
        └── # more locales
```

Each locale has its own folder under "assets/locales" and each locale contains a single file `translations.json`. This file contains a dictionary of key value pairs. For example, the `translations.json` file for English could contain:

```json
{
    "Workload_Display_Name" : "Fabric Sample Workload",
    "Workload_Display_Name_Full" : "Fabric Sample Workload",
    "Workload_Description": "Sample Workload Description"
}
```

Whereas the translation.json file for Spanish could contain:
```json
{
    "Workload_Display_Name" : "Carga de trabajo de muestra",
    "Workload_Display_Name_Full" : "Carga de trabajo de muestra",
    "Workload_Description": "Descripción del producto"
}
```

## Default behavior

* As previously stated, the only required language for a localized workload is English.
* If a workload is localized, **all** of the localization targets must be provided as keys in the `translations.json` file for English.
* Other provided languages aren't required to translate all keys. Any keys that are left untranslated default to the English translation provided. For example, if your workload name should always be in English, you don't need to provide a translation in any other language.
* We currently support both localized and unlocalized workloads. If there are any image files *directly* in the assets folder, the assumption is that the workload is unlocalized.
* In order for a workload to be treated as localized, it must have only two subdirectories in the assets folder, one named "images" and the other named "locales". There must not be any other files in the assets folder.

## Localization targets

All of the following properties are localized: `'displayName', 'fullDisplayName', 'displayNamePlural', 'description', 'introduction', 'title', 'tooltip', 'slogan'`.
In of the product and item manifest files, they correspond to the following attributes:

**Name**                                            | **Schema in Manifest**                           | **Description**
----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------

Quick action item tooltip                           | item.quickActionItems.tooltip                    | If the item has a quick action, the tooltip that appears when it's hovered over.

Full product display name                           | product.fullDisplayName                          | The full workload display name.
Product description                                 | product.description                              | The description that appears on the homepage of the workload.

## Access the language of the Fabric Portal

The workloadClient [provides an API](/javascript/api/@ms-fabric/workload-client/settingsapi) to retrieve the workload settings, which contain the current language of the Fabric Portal.
For example:

```javascript
export async function callLanguageGet(workloadClient: WorkloadClientAPI): Promise<string> {
    const settings = await workloadClient.settings.get();
    return settings.currentLanguageLocale;
}
```

With the provided `currentLanguageLocale` code, you can proceed to localize your workload using any framework you wish.
For example, in the sample workload repo, the library [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) is used to translate the contents of a message bar, which notifies the user of the current language.
