# Activate Fabric items

Fabric data pipelines and notebooks can be used to load or transform data in Microsoft Fabric. Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rules can take an action that starts jobs on other Fabric items, which can be used in the following scenarios:

* Start data pipelines when new files are loaded to Azure storage accounts, to load files into OneLake. You can learn more about [Azure Storage events](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview).

* Start Fabric notebooks when issues with data quality are found using Power BI reports. You can learn more about [getting data from Power BI](activator-get-data-power-bi.md).

## Activate a Fabric item

Start by selecting an existing rule or [creating a rule](activator-create-activators.md).

In the rule definition pane on the right side of the screen, find **Action** section to define the action when chosen condition is met. Select **Fabric item** as the action type and select a specific item from the [OneLake Data Hub](/fabric/get-started/onelake-data-hub) pop-up window.

## Test, start, or stop an [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule

Once you enter all of the required information, select **Save** to save the [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] rule. To test the rule, select **Test action**. To start the rule, select **Start** from the top menu bar and to stop the rule, select **Stop.** **Stop** only appears while a rule is active.
