# Get data for [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] from Real-Time Hub

You can get data for use in Fabric [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] from many sources. This article describes how to get data from Real-Time Hub. 

## Prerequisites

* You must have an activator already created.
* You can connect to Real-Time Hub events from an empty activator.
* You can connect to Real-Time Hub events from an activator that already has events flowing into it.

### Browse Real-Time Hub from [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)]

To browse Real-Time Hub items from an activator, select **Get data** from the toolbar as shown in the following image.

A wizard appears enabling you to add new events using the recommended connectors. You can also browse to existing streams and events in the Real-Time Hub in the table displayed at the bottom of the dialog.

When you choose a connector, a new eventstream is created to manage the connection and transformation of the new events.
