[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] is subject to the following general and specific limitations.

## General limitations

* Creating alerts for a report using Dynamic M parameters isn't supported.
* Creating alerts from the Fabric or Power BI Capacity Metrics app isn't supported.

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] also supports the following map visuals. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] only supports map visuals that use the *Location* field to specify the location of objects on the map. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] doesn't support visuals that use *Latitude* and *Longitude* fields.

* Bing Map
* Filled Map
* Azure Map

Additionally, for [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] to support a tile:

* The data in the tile must not be static.
* The data in the tile must be based on a KQL query.
* The tile must have at most one time range.
* The tile must be filtered by a predefined time range. Using a custom time range isn't supported.
* The tile must not contain time series data (for example, data created using the *make-series* KQL operator)

For more information, see [Limitations on charts with a time axis](activator-get-data-real-time-dashboard.md#limitations-on-charts-with-a-time-axis).

## Allowed recipients of email notifications

Each recipient of an email notification must have an internal email address. The recipient must belong to the organization that owns the Fabric tenant. [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] doesn't allow email notifications to be sent to either external email addresses or guest email addresses.

## Maximum data for rule processing limits

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] has a limit on the number of events that are processed in a rule based on the type of data being used in the rule. If your rule exceeds the maximum, [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] stops your rule. For eventstreams, the maximum is 1,000 events per second.

## Maximum number of actions

[!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] imposes the following limits on the number of actions that may occur in a given time period. If an action exceeds the limit, [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] may throttle or cancel the action.

|Rule action  |Scope  |Limit  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Email     |Messages/activator item/hour         |500        |
|Email     |Messages/rule/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/activator item/hour         |500        |
|Teams     |Messages/rule/recipient/hour   |30         |
|Teams     |Messages/recipient/hour           |100        |
|Teams     |Messages/Teams tenant/second      |50         |
|custom action |Power Automate flow executions/rule/hour      |10000      |
|Fabric item |Activations/user/minute| 50   |

## Maximum number of [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items

Your organization may have up to 250 [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items per region. If you try to create more than this number of items, you receive an error message. To resolve the error, either:

* Use an existing [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] item instead of creating a new item, or
* Delete some of your existing [!INCLUDE [fabric-activator](../includes/fabric-activator.md)] items.
