You can add a real-time weather source to an eventstream to stream real-time weather data from different locations. This source allows you to select specific city or latitude and longitude coordinates to receive weather information. This article shows you how to add a real-time weather source to an eventstream.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- [Create an eventstream](create-manage-an-eventstream.md) if you don't have one already.
