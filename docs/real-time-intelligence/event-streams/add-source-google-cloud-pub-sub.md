# Add Google Cloud Pub/Sub source to an eventstream

This article shows you how to add a Google Cloud Pub/Sub source to an eventstream. 

Google Pub/Sub is a messaging service that enables you to publish and subscribe to streams of events. You can add Google Pub/Sub as a source to your eventstream to capture, transform, and route real-time events to various destinations in Fabric.

[!INCLUDE [new-sources-regions-unsupported](./includes/new-sources-regions-unsupported.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Access to a workspace in the Fabric capacity license mode (or) the Trial license mode with Contributor or higher permissions. 
- A Google Cloud account with the Pub/Sub service enabled and a role with the required permissions.
- Your Google Cloud Pub/Sub source must be publicly accessible and not be behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.
- If you don't have an eventstream, [create an eventstream](create-manage-an-eventstream.md). 

## Add Google Cloud Pub/Sub as a source
[!INCLUDE [launch-connect-external-source](./includes/launch-connect-external-source.md)]

On the **Select a data source** page, search for and select **Connect** on the **Azure Event Hubs** tile.

## Configure and connect to Google Cloud Pub/Sub

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can consume the Google Cloud Pub/Sub events in only one eventstream. Once you fetch the events into an eventstream, they can't be consumed by other eventstreams.

[!INCLUDE [google-cloud-pub-sub-connector](./includes/google-cloud-pub-sub-source-connector.md)]

You can see the Google Cloud Pub/Sub source added to your eventstream in **Edit mode**.
