# Edit and publish a Microsoft Fabric eventstream

This article shows you how to edit and publish a Microsoft Fabric eventstream.



## Edit mode and Live view

Fabric event streams offer two distinct modes, **Edit mode** and **Live view**, to provide flexibility and control over your data streams. If you create a new eventstream with enhanced capabilities enabled, you can modify your eventstreams in **Edit mode** and design stream processing operations for your data streams by using a no-code editor. Once you're done, you can publish your eventstreams and visualize how your eventstreams start streaming and processing data in **Live view**.

Here's an overview of everything you find in the two different modes:

**Edit mode:**

- Any changes made within Edit mode aren't implemented until you choose to publish them, ensuring you have full control over the development process of your eventstreams.

- There's no risk of test data being streamed to your eventstreams or destinations. This mode is designed to provide a secure environment for testing without affecting your actual data streams.

- If you make changes to an existing eventstream, those changes aren't implemented until you publish the eventstream.

**Live view:**

- You can visualize how your eventstreams receive, transform, and route your events from sources to various destinations after you publish the changes.

- You can pause the flow of data on any selected sources and destinations, providing you with more control over your data streams.

## Create a new eventstream

[!INCLUDE [create-an-eventstream](./includes/create-an-eventstream.md)]

1. On the next screen, select **Add external source** to stream your data to Fabric event streams.

1. Select **Connect** on the **Azure Event Hubs** tile.

1. On the **Connect data source** page, select **New connection**.

1. In the popup window, in the **Connection settings** section, specify the name of the Event Hubs namespace and the event hub in it.

1. In the **Connection credentials** section, specify the access key name and its value, and then select **Connect**.

1. Now, on the **Connect** page, specify the **consumer group**, and select the **data format** you want to use, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Review + connect** page, review settings, and select **Add**.

## Publish your eventstream

To publish your eventstream, ensure that your eventstream has both a configured source and destination, and that no authoring errors display.

The following steps show how you can add event processing operations and a destination to your eventstream and then publish it.

1. You can expand the dropdown menu on the editor and choose a **Destination** or **Operation** to add to your eventstream.

1. The **Publish** button is disabled if there are any authoring errors. For example, you must add a destination for a **Filter** operation before you can publish it.

1. After you configure a Lakehouse destination, select **Publish** to commit your changes.

   This action switches your eventstream from **Edit** mode to **Live** view, initiating real-time data processing.
