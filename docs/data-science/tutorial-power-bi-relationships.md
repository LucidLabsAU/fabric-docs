# Tutorial: Discover relationships in a Power BI dataset using Semantic Link
This tutorial illustrates how to interact with Power BI from a Jupyter notebook and detect relationships between tables with the help of the SemPy library.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

### In this tutorial, you learn how to:
- Discover relationships in a Power BI dataset using Semantic Link's Python library ([SemPy](/python/api/semantic-link-sempy)).
- Use components of SemPy that support integration with Power BI and help to automate data quality analysis. These components include:
    - FabricDataFrame - a pandas-like structure enhanced with additional semantic information.
    - Functions for pulling Power BI datasets from a Fabric workspace into your notebook.
    - Functions that automate the evaluation of hypotheses about functional dependencies and that identify violations of relationships in your datasets.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites](./includes/prerequisites.md)]
* Select **Workspaces** from the left navigation pane to find and select your workspace. This workspace becomes your current workspace.

* Download the _Customer Profitability Sample.pbix_ and _Customer Profitability Sample (auto).pbix_ datasets from the [fabric-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/tree/main/docs-samples/data-science/datasets) and upload them to your workspace.

### Follow along in the notebook

The [powerbi_relationships_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/data-science/semantic-link-samples/powerbi_relationships_tutorial.ipynb) notebook accompanies this tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [follow-along](./includes/follow-along.md)]

## Set up the notebook

In this section, you set up a notebook environment with the necessary modules and data.

1. Install `SemPy` from PyPI using the `%pip` in-line installation capability within the notebook:

    ```python
    %pip install semantic-link
    ```

1. Perform necessary imports of SemPy modules that you'll need later:

    ```python
    import sempy.fabric as fabric
    
    from sempy.relationships import plot_relationship_metadata
    from sempy.relationships import find_relationships
    from sempy.fabric import list_relationship_violations
    ```

1. Import pandas for enforcing a configuration option that helps with output formatting:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
    ```

## Explore Power BI datasets

This tutorial uses a standard Power BI sample dataset [_Customer Profitability Sample.pbix_](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/data-science/datasets/Customer%20Profitability%20Sample.pbix). For a description of the dataset, see [Customer Profitability sample for Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/sample-customer-profitability).

- Use SemPy's `list_datasets` function to explore datasets in your current workspace:

    ```python
    fabric.list_datasets()
    ```

For the rest of this notebook you use two versions of the Customer Profitability Sample dataset:
-  *Customer Profitability Sample*: the dataset as it comes from Power BI samples with predefined table relationships
-  *Customer Profitability Sample (auto)*: the same data, but relationships are limited to those ones that Power BI would autodetect.
 

## Extract a sample dataset with its predefined semantic model

1. Load relationships that are predefined and stored within the _Customer Profitability Sample_ Power BI dataset, using SemPy's `list_relationships` function. This function lists from the Tabular Object Model:

    ```python
    dataset = "Customer Profitability Sample"
    relationships = fabric.list_relationships(dataset)
    relationships
    ```

1. Visualize the `relationships` DataFrame as a graph, using SemPy's `plot_relationship_metadata` function:

    ```python
    plot_relationship_metadata(relationships)
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-of-relationship-metadata.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a plot of the relationships between tables in the dataset." lightbox="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-of-relationship-metadata.png":::

This graph shows the "ground truth" for relationships between tables in this dataset, as it reflects how they were defined in Power BI by a subject matter expert.

## Complement relationships discovery

If you started with relationships that Power BI autodetected, you'd have a smaller set.

1. Visualize the relationships that Power BI autodetected in the dataset:

    ```python
    dataset = "Customer Profitability Sample (auto)"
    autodetected = fabric.list_relationships(dataset)
    plot_relationship_metadata(autodetected)
    ```
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-autodetected-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the relationships that Power BI autodetected in the dataset." lightbox="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-autodetected-relationships.png":::
        

    Power BI's autodetection missed many relationships. Moreover, two of the autodetected relationships are semantically incorrect:
    
    - `Executive[ID]` -> `Industry[ID]`
    - `BU[Executive_id]` -> `Industry[ID]`

1. Print the relationships as a table:

    ```python
    autodetected
    ```

    Incorrect relationships to the `Industry` table appear in rows with index 3 and 4. Use this information to remove these rows.

1. Discard the incorrectly identified relationships.

    ```python
    autodetected.drop(index=[3,4], inplace=True)
    autodetected
    ```

    Now you have correct, but incomplete relationships.

1. Visualize these incomplete relationships, using `plot_relationship_metadata`:

    ```python
    plot_relationship_metadata(autodetected)
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-incomplete-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a visualization of relationships after removing incorrect ones." lightbox="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-incomplete-relationships.png":::

1. Load all the tables from the dataset, using SemPy's `list_tables` and `read_table` functions:

    ```python
    tables = {table: fabric.read_table(dataset, table) for table in fabric.list_tables(dataset)['Name']}
    
    tables.keys()
    ```

1. Find relationships between tables, using `find_relationships`, and review the log output to get some insights into how this function works:

    ```python
    suggested_relationships_all = find_relationships(
        tables,
        name_similarity_threshold=0.7,
        coverage_threshold=0.7,
        verbose=2
    )
    ```

1. Visualize newly discovered relationships:

    ```python
    plot_relationship_metadata(suggested_relationships_all)
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-newly-discovered-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows visualization of newly discovered relationships." lightbox="media/tutorial-power-bi-relationships/plot-metadata-for-newly-discovered-relationships.png":::
    
    SemPy was able to detect all relationships. 

1. Use the `exclude` parameter to limit the search to additional relationships that weren't identified previously:

    ```python
    additional_relationships = find_relationships(
        tables,
        exclude=autodetected,
        name_similarity_threshold=0.7,
        coverage_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    additional_relationships
    ```

## Validate the relationships

1. First, load the data from the _Customer Profitability Sample_ dataset:

    ```python
    dataset = "Customer Profitability Sample"
    tables = {table: fabric.read_table(dataset, table) for table in fabric.list_tables(dataset)['Name']}
    
    tables.keys()
    ```

1. Check for overlap of primary and foreign key values by using the `list_relationship_violations` function. Supply the output of the `list_relationships` function as input to `list_relationship_violations`:

    ```python
    list_relationship_violations(tables, fabric.list_relationships(dataset))
    ```

    The relationship violations provide some interesting insights. For example, one out of seven values in `Fact[Product Key]` isn't present in `Product[Product Key]`, and this missing key is `50`.

Exploratory data analysis is an exciting process, and so is data cleaning. There's always something that the data is hiding, depending on how you look at it, what you want to ask, and so on. Semantic Link provides you with new tools that you can use to achieve more with your data.
