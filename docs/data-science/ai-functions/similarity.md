# Calculate similarity with the `ai.similarity` function

The `ai.similarity` function uses Generative AI to compare two string values and calculate a semantic similarity scoreâ€”all in just a single line of Python or PySpark code. You can compare text values from one column of a DataFrame to pairwise values in another column or to a single text value. Similarity scores range from -1 (opposites) to 1 (identical), with 0 indicating that the values are completely unrelated in meaning.
