# Summarize text with the `ai.summarize` function

The `ai.summarize` function uses Generative AI to generate summaries of input text (either values in a single column of a DataFrame or rows in the entire DataFrame)â€”all in just a single line of code.

To learn more about the full set of AI functions, which unlock dynamic insights by putting the power of Fabric's native LLM into your hands, please visit [this overview article](ai-function-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

## Use `ai.summarize` with pandas

[TBD]

### Syntax

# [Summarizing column values](#tab/column-summary)

```python
df["summaries"] = df["text"].ai.summarize()
```

# [Summarizing DataFrame rows](#tab/dataframe-summary)

```python
df["summaries"] = df.ai.summarize()
```

---

### Parameters

None

### Returns

A [pandas Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) containing summaries for each row of input text. If the input text is `null`, the result will be `null`.

### Example

# [Summarizing column values](#tab/column-summary)

        the cream was infused with diamond dust to give it an extra sparkle, thereby
        justifying, at least in his mind, its exorbitant cost. The board recommends
        immediate disciplinary action.

## Use `ai.summarize` with PySpark

[TBD]

### Syntax

# [Summarizing column values](#tab/column-summary)

```python
df.ai.summarize(input_col="text", output_col="summaries")
```

# [Summarizing DataFrame rows](#tab/dataframe-summary)

```python
df.ai.summarize(output_col="summaries")
```

### Parameters

| **Name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **`input_col`** <br> Optional | A [string](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.types.StringType.html) containing the name of an existing column with input text values to be summarized |
| **`output_col`** <br> Optional | A [string](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.types.StringType.html) containing the name of a new column to store summaries for each row of input text |

### Returns

A [Spark DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/dataframe.html) with a new column containing summarized text for each row of input text. If the input text is `null`, the result will be `null`. If no input column is specified, the function will summarize the entire DataFrame.
