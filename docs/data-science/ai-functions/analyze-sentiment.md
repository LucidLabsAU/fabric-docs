# Detect sentiment with the `ai.analyze_sentiment` function

The `ai.analyze_sentiment` function uses Generative AI to detect whether the emotional state expressed by input text is positive, negative, mixed, or neutral—all in just a single line of Python or PySpark code. If the sentiment can’t be determined, the output is left blank.
