# OneLake security

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

OneLake uses a layered security model built around the organizational structure of experiences within Microsoft Fabric. Security is derived from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and is compatible with user identities, service principals, and managed identities. Using Azure AD and Fabric components, you can build out robust security mechanisms across OneLake, ensuring that you keep your data safe while also reducing copies and minimizing complexity.

## Workspace security

The workspace is the primary security boundary for data within OneLake. Each workspace represents a single domain or project area where teams can collaborate on data. You manage security in the workspace through Fabric workspace roles. Learn more about Fabric role-based access control (RBAC): [Workspace roles](../get-started/roles-workspaces.md)

Workspace roles in Fabric grant the following permissions in OneLake.

| **Capability** | **Admin** | **Member** | **Contributor** | **Viewer** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| View files in OneLake | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Write files in OneLake | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

## Item security

Within a workspace, Fabric items can have permissions configured separately from the workspace roles. You can configure permissions either through sharing an item or by managing the permissions of an item. The following permissions determine a user's ability to perform actions on data in OneLake.

| **Permission Name** | **Sharing text** | **Can view files in OneLake?** | **Can write files in OneLake?** | **Can read data through SQL endpoint?** |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Read | *No share boxes selected* | No | No | No |
| ReadData | Read all SQL endpoint data | No | No | Yes |
| ReadAll | Read all Apache Spark | Yes | No | No |
| Write | *N/A, only available through workspace roles* | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Compute-specific security

Some compute engines in Fabric have their own security models. For example, Fabric Warehouse lets users define access using T-SQL statements. Compute-specific security is always enforced when you access data using that engine, but those conditions may not apply to users in certain Fabric roles when they access OneLake directly. For more information on what types of compute security you can define, see the documentation for Warehouse, Real-time analytics, and Power BI datasets.

As a rule, users in the Viewer role can only access data through select compute engines and any security rules defined in those engines apply. All other roles have direct OneLake access, allowing them to query data through Spark, APIs, or a OneLake File Explorer. However, compute-specific security still applies to those users when accessing data through that compute engine.

**Example:** Martha is an administrator for a Fabric workspace and Pradeep is a viewer. Martha wants to restrict access to certain tables in **LakehouseA**. She connects to SQL and defines object level security using GRANT and DENY statements. When Pradeep accesses the data through SQL, he's only able to see the tables from **LakehouseA** that he was granted access to.

## Shortcut security

Shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric allow for simplified data management, but have some security considerations to note. For information on managing shortcut security see this [document](onelake-shortcuts.md#types-of-shortcuts).

## Authentication

OneLake uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication; you can use it to give permissions to user identities and service principals. OneLake automatically extracts the user identity from tools, which use Azure AD authentication and map it to the permissions you set in the Fabric portal.

> [!NOTE]
> To use service principals in a Fabric tenant, a tenant administrator must enable Service Principal Names (SPNs) for the entire tenant or specific security groups.

## Private links

Fabric doesnâ€™t currently support private link access to OneLake data via non-Fabric products and Spark.

## Allow apps running outside of Fabric to access data via OneLake

OneLake allows you to restrict access to data from applications running outside of Fabric environments. Admins can find the setting in the tenant admin portal.
When you turn this switch ON, users can access data via all sources. When you turn the switch OFF, users can't access data via applications running outside of Fabric environments. For example, users can access data via applications like Azure Databricks, custom applications using Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) APIs, or OneLake file explorer.
