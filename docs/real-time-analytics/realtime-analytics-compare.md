# What is the difference between Real-Time Analytics and Azure Data Explorer?

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Real-Time Analytics is a data analytics SaaS experience in the Microsoft Fabric offering. Azure Data Explorer is a PaaS service in Azure. Kusto in Real-Time Analytics (KQL Database and KQL Queryset) and Azure Data Explorer share the same core engine with the identical core capabilities, but different management behavior. This article details the difference between the two services. Real-Time Analytics also offers other capabilities, such as [Eventstreams](event-streams/overview.md), and has many aspects that are managed at the workspace level.

For more information on Real-Time Analytics, see [What is Real-Time Analytics in Fabric?](overview.md).

## Integrated work mode

The two services allow for an integrated work model whereby data can be loaded to one service and consumed from the other.

You can query data from your KQL database in the query editor of Azure Data Explorer. Similarly, you can use your KQL Queryset to analyze data loaded into a database in Azure Data Explorer.
