# Real-Time Analytics tutorial part 5: Use advanced KQL queries

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 4: Explore your data with KQL and SQL](tutorial-4-explore.md).

## Create a KQL queryset

In the following step, you use the advanced data analysis capabilities of Kusto Query Language to query the two tables you've ingested into the database.

1. Browse to your KQL database named *NycTaxiDB*.
1. Select **New related item** > **KQL Queryset**

1. Enter *nyctaxiqs* as the KQL queryset name.
1. Select **Create**. The KQL queryset opens with several autopopulated example queries.

## Query data

This section walks you through some of the query and visualization capabilities of the KQL queryset. Copy and paste the queries in your own query editor to run and visualize the results.

1. The following query returns the top 10 pickup locations in New York City for Yellow Taxis.

    ```kusto
    nyctaxitrips
    | summarize Count=count() by PULocationID
    | top 10 by Count
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/realtime-analytics-tutorial/top-10-by-count.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query result in Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric.":::

1. This query adds a step to the previous query by looking up the corresponding zones of the top 10 pickup locations using the *Locations* table. The [lookup operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/lookupoperator?context=/fabric/context/context&pivots=fabric) extends the columns of a fact table with values looked-up in a dimension table.

    ```kusto
    nyctaxitrips
    | lookup (Locations) on $left.PULocationID == $right.LocationID
    | summarize Count=count() by Zone
    | top 10 by Count
    | render columnchart
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/realtime-analytics-tutorial/top-10-locations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of top 10 location results in Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric." lightbox="media/realtime-analytics-tutorial/top-10-locations.png":::

1. KQL also provides machine learning functions to detect anomalies. Let's check anomalies in the tips given by the customers in the Manhattan borough. This query uses the [series_decompose_anomalies function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/series-decompose-anomaliesfunction?context=/fabric/context/context&pivots=fabric).

    ```kusto
    nyctaxitrips
    | lookup (Locations) on $left.PULocationID==$right.LocationID
    | where Borough == "Manhattan"
    | make-series s1 = avg(tip_amount) on tpep_pickup_datetime from datetime(2022-06-01) to datetime(2022-06-04) step 1h
    | extend anomalies = series_decompose_anomalies(s1)
    | render anomalychart with (anomalycolumns=anomalies)
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/realtime-analytics-tutorial/anomaly-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of anomaly chart result in Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric." lightbox="media/realtime-analytics-tutorial/anomaly-chart.png":::

    Hover over the red dots to see the values of the anomalies.

1. You can also use the predictive power of the [series_decompose_forecast function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/series-decompose-forecastfunction?context=/fabric/context/context&pivots=fabric) to ensure that the sufficient taxis are working in the Manhattan borough and forecast the number of taxis needed per hour.

    ```kusto
    nyctaxitrips
    | lookup (Locations) on $left.PULocationID==$right.LocationID
    | where Borough == "Manhattan"
    | make-series s1 = count() on tpep_pickup_datetime from datetime(2022-06-01) to datetime(2022-06-08)+3d step 1h by PULocationID
    | extend forecast = series_decompose_forecast(s1, 24*3)
    | render timechart
    ```
