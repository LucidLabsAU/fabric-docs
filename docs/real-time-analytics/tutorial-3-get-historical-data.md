# Real-Time Analytics tutorial part 3: Get historical data

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial is part of a series. For the previous section, see: [Tutorial part 2: Get data with Eventstream](tutorial-2-event-streams.md).

One-time data loading is often needed for historical data, or for adding dimension tables. Recall that the dataset you've ingested with Eventstream doesn't contain latitude and longitude data. In this section, you're going to load additional information on the pick-up locations and drop-off from a blob storage container.

## Get dimension data from blob storage

1. Browse to your KQL database named *NycTaxiDB*.
1. Select **Get data** > **Blob container**.

    An **Ingest data** window opens with the **Destination** tab selected.

### Destination tab

1. Under **Table**, make sure that **New table** is selected, and enter *Locations* as the table name.
1. Select **Next: Source**.

### Source tab

In the **Source** tab, **Source type** is auto populated with *Blob container*.

1. Fill out the remaining fields according to the following table:

    |  **Setting**  | **Suggested value**  | **Field description**
    |-------|---|------
    | Ingestion  |   *One-time*         |The type of data ingestion type.
    | Link to source |  *https://azuresynapsestorage.blob.core.windows.net/sampledata/NYCTaxiLocations/* | URI to the blob container where the files are located |
    | Sample size |  *Blank*
    | Folder path |  *Blank*
    | Schema  defining file |  Choose the first file

1. Select **Next: Schema**.

### Schema tab

The tool automatically infers the schema based on your data. No changes are necessary.

Select **Next: Summary**.

### Summary tab

In the **Data ingestion completed** window, all steps are marked with green check marks when the data has been successfully
loaded.
