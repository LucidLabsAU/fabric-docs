# Change the data retention policy

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

The retention policy controls the mechanism that automatically removes data from tables or [materialized views](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/materialized-views/materialized-view-overview?context=/fabric/context/context&pivots=fabric). It's useful to remove data that continuously flows into a table, and whose relevance is age-based. For example, the policy can be used for a table that holds diagnostics events that may become uninteresting after two weeks. The default data retention policy is 36,500 days.

For more information, see [Retention policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/retentionpolicy?context=/fabric/context/context).  

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [KQL database](create-database.md)

## Change data retention policy

1. Browse to your KQL database and select the **Manage** > **Data retention policy**
