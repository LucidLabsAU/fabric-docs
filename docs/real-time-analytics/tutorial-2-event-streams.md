## Stream data from Eventstream to your KQL database

1. In the Eventstream authoring area, select **New source** > **Sample data**.
1. Enter **nytaxitripsdatasource** as the Source Name, and then select **Yellow
    Taxi** from the dropdown of **Sample data**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. In the Eventstream authoring area, select **New destination** > **KQL Database**.
1. In the **KQL Database** pane, fill out the fields as follows:

    |Field  | Suggested value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Destination name**     |  *nytaxidatabase* |
    | **Workspace**     |   The workspace in which you [created a database](tutorial-1-resources.md#create-a-kql-database).      |
    | **KQL Database**     | *NycTaxiDB* |

1. Select **Add and configure.**

    A data ingestion pane opens with the **Destination** tab selected.

## Configure data loading to the KQL database

1. Select **New table**,  and enter *nyctaxitrips* as the table name.
1. Select **Next: Source** to open the **Source tab**.
1. Review the default values. The data connection name is made from the database name and the eventstream name.

1. Select **Next: Schema** to open the **Schema** tab.

## Schema mapping

1. The incoming data source is uncompressed, so keep the **Compression type** as *uncompressed*.
1. From the **Data format** dropdown, select **JSON**.

    Notice that the data preview refreshes and shows the data in columns with the data types automatically identified. Some of these data types need to be changed for later queries. The columns that appear in the preview can be manipulated by selecting the **down arrow** to the right of the column name.

### Change data types

1. Change the following columns to the target types by selecting the **down arrow**> **Change data type**. Verify that the following columns reflect the correct data type:

    | Column name | Target data type|
    |--|--|
    | VendorID | *int* |
    | passenger_count | *long*
    | trip_distance | *real*
    | PULocationID | *long*
    | DOLocationID | *long*
    | payment_type | *real*
    | fare_amount | *real*
    | extra | *real*
    | mta_tax | *real*
    | tip_amount | *real*
    | tolls_amount | *real*
    | improvement_surcharge | *real*
    | total_amount | *real*
    | congestion_surcharge | *real*
    | airport_fee | *real*

1. Select **Next: Summary**.

     In the **Continuous ingestion from Eventstream established** window, all steps are marked with green check marks when the data connection is successfully created. The data from Eventstream begins streaming automatically into your table.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to refresh the page to view your table after the Eventstream connection has been established.
