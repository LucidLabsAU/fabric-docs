# Add and manage an event source in an eventstream

Once you have created an eventstream, you can connect it to various data sources and destinations. The types of event sources that you can add to your eventstream include Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, Sample data, and Custom app.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your eventstream is located.
- To add an Azure Event Hubs or Azure IoT Hub as eventstream source, you need to have appropriate permission to access its policy keys. They must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Supported sources

The following sources are supported by Fabric Eventstream:

| Sources          | Description |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Azure Event Hubs | If you have an Azure event hub, you can ingest event hub data into Microsoft Fabric using Eventstream.  |
| Azure IoT Hub | If you have an Azure IoT hub, you can ingest IoT data into Microsoft Fabric using Eventstream.  |
| Sample data | You can choose **Yellow Taxi** or **Stock Market events** as a sample data source to test the data ingestion while setting up an eventstream. |
| Custom App | The custom app feature allows your applications or Kafka clients to connect to Eventstream using a connection string, enabling the smooth ingestion of streaming data into Eventstream. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The total count of sources and destinations for one eventstream is **11**.
> - Event data retention in an eventstream is **1 day**, with the potential to extend it and make it configurable in the future.

## Add an Azure event hub as a source

If you have an Azure event hub created with streaming data, follow these steps to add an Azure event hub as your eventstream source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Azure Event Hubs**.

1. Enter a source name for the new source and select a cloud connection to your Azure event hub.

## Add a sample data as a source

To get a better understanding of how an eventstream works, you can use the out-of-box sample data provided and send data to the eventstream. Follow these steps to add a sample data source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Sample data**.

1. On the right pane, enter a source name to appear on the canvas, select the sample data you want to add to your eventstream, and then select **Add**.
   - **Yellow Taxi**: sample taxi data with a preset schema that includes fields such as pickup time, drop-off time, distance, total fee, and more.
   - **Stock Market**: sample data of a stock exchange with a preset schema column such as time, symbol, price, volume and more.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sample data source configuration.":::

1. When the sample data source is added successfully, you can find it on the canvas and navigation pane.

To verify if the sample data is added successfully, select **Data preview** in the bottom pane.

## Add custom application as a source

If you want to connect your own application with an eventstream, you can add a custom app source. Then, send data to the eventstream with your own application with the connection endpoint exposed in the custom app. Follow these steps to add a custom app source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Custom App**.

1. Enter a **Source name** for the custom app and select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source configuration.":::

Once you've successfully added the custom app, you can view the information of the custom app such as connection string and use it in your application.

The endpoint exposed by the custom app is in the connection string, which is an **event hub compatible connection string**. You can use it in your application to send events to your eventstream. The following example shows what the connection string looks like:

*`Endpoint=sb://eventstream-xxxxxxxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=key_xxxxxxxx;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxx;EntityPath=es_xxxxxxxx`*

:::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-completed.png" :::

## Manage source

- **Edit/remove**: You can select an eventstream source to edit or remove either through the navigation pane or canvas. When you select **Edit**, the edit pane opens in the right of the main editor.
