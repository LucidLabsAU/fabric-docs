# Monitoring status and performance of an eventstream

The Microsoft Fabric event streams feature allows you to easily monitor streaming event data, ingestion status, and ingestion performance. This article explains how to monitor the eventstream status, check logs, errors, and data insights with metrics.

In an eventstream, there are two types of monitoring experiences: **Data insights** and **Runtime logs**. You see one or both views, depending on the source or destination you select.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must have:

- Access to a **premium workspace** with **Viewer** or above permissions where your Eventstream item is located.
- An Azure event hub source or lakehouse destination added to your eventstream.

## Data insights

The **Data insights** tab appears in the lower pane of the main editor. The tab provides metrics that you can use to monitor the status and performance of the eventstream, sources, and destinations. Different sources and destinations have different metrics. When you select a node in the main editor canvas, the metrics for that specific node appear in the **Data insights** tab.

### Data insights in an eventstream node

The following metrics appear for an eventstream node on the **Data insights** tab:

| Metric | Unit | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **IncomingMessages** | Count | The number of events or messages sent to an eventstream over a specified period. |
| **OutgoingMessages** | Count | The number of events or messages outflow from an eventstream over a specified period. |
| **IncomingBytes** | Bytes | Incoming bytes for an eventstream over a specified period. |
| **OutgoingBytes** | Bytes | Outgoing bytes for an eventstream over a specified period. |

To view data insights for an eventstream:

1. Select the eventstream node in the main editor canvas.

1. In the lower pane, select the **Data insights** tab.

1. If there's data inside the eventstream, the metrics chart appears on the **Data insights** tab.

1. On the right side of the tab, select the checkboxes next to the metrics you want to display.

### Data insights in Azure event hub source and lakehouse destination nodes

The following metrics are available on the **Data insights** tab for Azure event hub source and lakehouse destination nodes:

| Metric | Unit | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Input events** | Count | Number of event data that the eventstream engine pulls from an eventstream (in a lakehouse destination) or from an Azure event hub source (in an Azure event hub source). |
| **Input event bytes** | Bytes | Amount of event data that the eventstream engine pulls from an eventstream (in a lakehouse destination) or from an Azure event hub source (in an Azure event hub source). |
| **Output events** | Count | Number of event data that the eventstream engine sends to a lakehouse (in a lakehouse destination) or an eventstream (in an Azure event hub source). |
| **Backlogged input events** | Count | Number of input events that are backlogged in the eventstream engine. |
| **Runtime errors** | Count | Total number of errors related to event processing. |
| **Data conversion errors** | Count | Number of output events that couldn't be converted to the expected output schema. |
| **deserialization errors** | Count | Number of input events that couldn't be deserialized inside the eventstream engine. |

To view the data insights for an Azure event hub source or a lakehouse destination:

1. Select the Azure event hub source node or lakehouse destination node in the main editor canvas

1. In the lower pane, select the **Data insights** tab.

1. If there's data inside the Azure event hub source or lakehouse destination, the metrics chart appears on the **Data insights** tab.

1. On the right side of the tab, select the checkboxes next to the metrics you want to display.

## Runtime logs

The **Runtime logs** tab enables you to check the detailed logs that occur in the eventstream engine. Runtime logs have three severity levels: warning, error, and information.

To view the runtime logs for an Azure event hub source or a lakehouse destination:

1. Select the Azure event hub source node or lakehouse destination node in the main editor canvas.

1. In the lower pane, select the **Runtime logs** tab.

1. If there's data inside the Azure event hub source or lakehouse destination, the logs appear on the **Runtime logs** tab.

1. Search the logs with the **Filter by keyword** option, or filter the list by changing the severity or type.

1. To see the most current logs, select **Refresh**.
