# Query data in a KQL queryset

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create and use a new KQL queryset.

The KQL Queryset is the item used to run queries, view, and customize query results on data from a KQL database.  Each tab in the KQL queryset can be associated with a different KQL database, and lets your save queries for later use or share with others to collaborate on data exploration. You can also change the KQL database associated with any tab, allowing you to run the same query on data in different states.

The KQL Queryset uses the Kusto Query language for creating queries, and also supports many SQL functions. For more information about the query language, see [Kusto Query Language overview](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/index?context=/fabric/context/context).

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* A [KQL database](create-database.md) with data

## Create a KQL queryset

The KQL Queryset exists within the context of a workspace. A new KQL queryset is always associated with the workspace you're using when you create it.

1. Browse to the desired workspace.
1. Select **+New** > **KQL Queryset**

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/new-queryset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a new KQL queryset from workspace homepage.":::

1. Enter a unique name. You can use alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Special characters aren't supported.

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/queryset-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding name to queryset.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can create multiple KQL Querysets in a single workspace.

1. Select **Create**

### Open an existing queryset

1. To access an existing queryset, browse to your workspace.
1. Select the desired KQL Queryset from the list of items.
1. Optionally, you can reduce the number of items displayed by filtering on the item type. Select **Filter**>**KQL Queryset**

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/filter-queryset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of filtering types of items in workspace.":::

1. Select the KQL queryset from the list of items that appear in the workspace.

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/open-existing-query-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Fabric workspace showing KQL Querysets." lightbox="media/kusto-query-set/open-existing-query-set.png":::

## Connect to a database

Queries run in the context of a database. You can change the associated database at any point, and retain the queries saved in the query editor.

1. To connect your KQL queryset to a database, select **Select database**, and then select a database from the data hub that appears.

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/select-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the KQL queryset database selection pane. The option titled Select  database is highlighted.":::

A list of tables associated with this database will appear below the database name.

## Manage tabs

:::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/manage-tabs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options for editing tabs in the KQL Queryset.":::

* **Rename a tab**: Select the **pencil icon** next to the tab name.
* **Add a new tab**: Select the plus **+** to the right of the existing tabs. Different tabs can be connected to different databases.
* **Change the existing database connection**: Under **Database**, select the existing database connection to open the data hub.

## Write a query

Now that you're connected to your data source, you can run queries on this data. The KQL Queryset uses the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query data from any of the databases you have access to. To learn more about KQL, see [Kusto Query Language overview](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

The following examples use data that is publicly available at [https://kustosamples.blob.core.windows.net/samplefiles/StormEvents.csv](https://kustosamples.blob.core.windows.net/samplefiles/StormEvents.csv).

1. Write or copy a query in the top pane of the KQL Queryset.
1. Select the **Run** button, or press **Shift**+**Enter** to run the query.

    The resulting query output is displayed in the results grid, which appears below the query pane. Notice the green check indicating that the query has finished successfully, and time used to compute the query results.

## Copy query

You may want to copy or share the queries you create.

1. At the top of the query window, select the **Manage** tab.
1. Select **Copy**

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/copy-query-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage tab of the KQL Queryset showing the dropdown of the copy query or query results option.":::

1. You can either select **Query** to copy the text of the most recent query, or select **Results** to copy the output table.
1. You can now paste this information into any editor, such as Microsoft Word.

## Export query data as CSV

Instead of simply copy-pasting the query output, you can also export the query results.

This is a one-time method to export a CSV file containing the query results.

1. At the top of the query window, select the **Manage** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/kusto-query-set/export-csv.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage tab of the KQL Queryset showing the highlighted option to export results to CSV.":::

1. Select **Export results to CSV**.
1. Save the CSV file locally.

## Delete KQL queryset

1. Select the workspace to which your KQL queryset is associated.
1. Hover over the KQL queryset you wish to delete. Select **More [...]**, then select **Delete**.
